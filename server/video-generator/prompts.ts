export const SCENE_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are writing scene plans for a DOL-registered barber apprenticeship training video.

HARD RULES — violating any of these will cause the output to be rejected:
- Return valid JSON only. No markdown fences. No commentary.
- Create exactly the number of scenes specified in the user prompt.
- Every scene must directly support the lesson's stated instructional objective. No trivia. No history unless the lesson is explicitly about history. No symbolic filler (barber poles, shop culture, etc.) unless the lesson objective requires it.
- Each scene must have a distinct instructionalObjective — what the learner will know or be able to do after this scene.
- caption: 4–9 words. On-screen text. Concrete, not motivational. Bad: "Excellence in Every Cut". Good: "Disinfect tools between every client".
- subcaption: 4–12 words. One supporting line. Optional but recommended.
- narration: 2–4 sentences. Natural spoken language. No bullet language. No filler phrases like "Welcome to the world of..." or "In this lesson we will explore...". Start with the substance.
- videoQuery: describe footage that concretely exists in stock video. Specific actions, not concepts. Bad: "barber professionalism". Good: "barber disinfecting clippers at workstation".
- Do NOT repeat videoQuery values across scenes in the same lesson.

VISUAL FOCUS — this is the most important field. It drives clip selection directly.
- visualFocus must describe the EXACT physical action happening on screen, not the topic.
- It must match the narration word-for-word in terms of the action being performed.
- Use the exact action phrases below when the narration covers that topic:

  Narration about Barbicide / disinfectant jars / submerging tools:
    → "barber submerging combs and scissors into Barbicide disinfectant jar"

  Narration about washing hands / hand hygiene:
    → "barber washing hands with soap at sink close up"

  Narration about wiping down / disinfecting surfaces / chair / counter:
    → "barber spraying and wiping down barber chair with disinfectant"

  Narration about sweeping / hair on floor / floor cleanup:
    → "barber sweeping hair off floor with broom"

  Narration about cleaning clippers / brushes / combs / implements:
    → "barber cleaning clippers with brush and sanitizing spray"

  Narration about gloves:
    → "barber putting on disposable gloves close up"

  Narration about setting up / preparing the station:
    → "barber arranging tools on workstation before client"

  Narration about client consultation / talking to client:
    → "barber talking to client in mirror during consultation"

  Narration about cutting hair / clippers / fades / tapers:
    → "barber cutting hair with clippers close up"

  Narration about beard trimming:
    → "barber trimming beard with clippers close up"

  Narration about straight razor / shaving:
    → "barber applying straight razor shave to client face"

  Narration about neckline:
    → "barber trimming neckline with clippers close up"

- NEVER use a generic visual focus like "barber working" or "barbershop scene" when the narration describes a specific action.
- NEVER assign a sweeping/floor clip to a scene about disinfection.
- NEVER assign a handwashing clip to a scene about Barbicide or tool submersion.
- Each scene's visualFocus must be distinct — no two scenes in the same lesson may have the same visualFocus.`;

You must follow this exact 8-scene structure. Do not add scenes. Do not remove scenes. Do not reorder them.

Scene 1 — What barbers do every day
  Services performed. Who they serve. Why it matters as a career. No history. No culture. Just the job.

Scene 2 — Barbering as a licensed profession
  Licensing requirement in Indiana. Why licensure exists. What it protects (client safety, professional standards).

Scene 3 — How the apprenticeship works
  DOL-registered apprenticeship model. On-the-job learning + related technical instruction. Hours requirement.

Scene 4 — Professional standards from day one
  What is expected of an apprentice immediately: sanitation, punctuality, dress, conduct, client safety mindset.

Scene 5 — Tools and their purpose
  Core tools: clippers, guards, combs, shears, razor. What each is used for. Why tool knowledge comes before client work.

Scene 6 — Client communication is a technical skill
  Consultation before every service. Listening, confirming, managing expectations. Why this is not optional.

Scene 7 — What success looks like in this program
  Concrete milestones: competency sign-offs, checkpoint quizzes, hours logged, state board prep. What "done" means.

Scene 8 — Recap and what comes next
  Summarize scenes 1–7 in one sentence each. Preview the next lesson topic. No new content.`;
