/**
 * Types for the NHA training partner agreement.
 *
 * PaymentResponsibility describes who pays NHA for each cost component:
 *   institution — Elevate pays NHA upfront; cost is recovered in the bundle price
 *   candidate   — student pays directly (retakes only)
 *   split       — shared cost (not currently used in the NHA agreement)
 *
 * This is agreement metadata, not checkout logic. The checkout system reads
 * bundle retail prices from nha-pricing.ts. Retake enforcement is handled
 * by the testing_enforcement table and /api/testing/retake.
