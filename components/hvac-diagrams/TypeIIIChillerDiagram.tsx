    title: 'What is a Low-Pressure System?',
    content: `Low-pressure systems operate below atmospheric pressure (below 0 PSIG) during normal operation. This is the opposite of high-pressure systems like R-410A which operate well above atmospheric pressure.

The most common low-pressure refrigerants are R-11, R-113, and R-123. These are used in large centrifugal chillers — the massive refrigeration machines that cool large commercial buildings, hospitals, and universities.

Because the system operates in a vacuum, air and moisture can leak IN rather than refrigerant leaking out. This is the key difference from Type I and Type II systems.`,
    fact: 'R-123 (HCFC) is the current low-pressure refrigerant used in centrifugal chillers. It replaced R-11 (CFC) which was phased out in 1996.',
  },
  {
    id: 'purge',
    title: 'Purge Units — What They Do',
    content: `Because low-pressure systems operate in a vacuum, air and moisture continuously leak into the system. A purge unit (also called a purge recovery unit) removes this non-condensable air and moisture from the chiller.

The purge unit works by drawing off the air/refrigerant mixture from the top of the condenser (where non-condensables collect), separating the refrigerant from the air, and venting the air while returning the refrigerant to the system.

Under EPA regulations, purge units must be high-efficiency units that limit refrigerant emissions. The EPA requires that purge units emit no more than 0.5 lbs of refrigerant per pound of air purged. Older purge units that do not meet this standard must be replaced.

Purge unit emissions must be logged. If a chiller loses more than 10% of its charge in a 12-month period, the leak must be repaired.`,
    fact: 'Purge unit logs are required by EPA. If your chiller is losing refrigerant faster than the purge unit can account for, you have a leak that must be found and repaired.',
  },
  {
    id: 'leak_test',
    title: 'Leak Testing — Pressurization (Not Vacuum)',
    content: `This is the most counterintuitive part of Type III: you test for leaks by pressurizing the system, not by pulling a vacuum.

Why? Because the system normally operates in a vacuum. If you pull a vacuum to test for leaks, you are just recreating normal operating conditions — you cannot tell if there is a leak. Instead, you pressurize the system with dry nitrogen or the system's own refrigerant vapor to bring it above atmospheric pressure. Then you use an electronic leak detector or soap bubbles to find leaks.

Pressurization procedure:
1. Isolate the section to be tested
2. Pressurize with dry nitrogen to a pressure above atmospheric (typically 3–5 PSIG)
3. Check all joints, valves, and fittings with a leak detector
4. Never pressurize above the system's maximum allowable working pressure

Important: Never use oxygen or compressed air to pressurize a refrigerant system. Oxygen + refrigerant oil = explosion risk.`,
    fact: 'ASHRAE Standard 15 governs the safe use of refrigerants in mechanical rooms. It requires leak detectors, ventilation, and emergency shutoffs for systems using low-pressure refrigerants.',
  },
  {
    id: 'recovery',
    title: 'Recovery Requirements for Type III',
    content: `Recovery from low-pressure systems has different requirements than high-pressure systems because of the below-atmospheric operating pressure.

Required recovery level for low-pressure systems:
- Systems manufactured after November 15, 1993: recover to 25 mm Hg absolute (approximately 29 in. Hg vacuum)
- Systems manufactured before November 15, 1993: recover to 25 mm Hg absolute

The recovery equipment must be rated for low-pressure refrigerants. Standard high-pressure recovery machines are not designed for the deep vacuum levels required for low-pressure systems.

After recovery, the system will be at a deep vacuum. Before opening the system, you must break the vacuum with dry nitrogen to bring the system to atmospheric pressure. This prevents air and moisture from rushing in when you open the system.`,
    fact: '25 mm Hg absolute is a very deep vacuum — approximately 29 in. Hg on a standard vacuum gauge. This is much deeper than the 15 in. Hg required for large high-pressure systems.',
  },
  {
    id: 'ashrae',
    title: 'ASHRAE Standard 15',
    content: `ASHRAE Standard 15 — Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems — sets requirements for mechanical rooms that contain refrigeration equipment. The exam tests several specific requirements.

Key ASHRAE 15 requirements for low-pressure systems:
- Refrigerant detectors must be installed in the mechanical room, set to alarm at the TLV (Threshold Limit Value) of the refrigerant
- Emergency ventilation must be capable of exhausting the mechanical room air
- Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) must be available outside the mechanical room
- Pressure relief valves must discharge to the outdoors or to a purge recovery system
- The mechanical room must have a means to shut off refrigerant flow in an emergency

R-123 has a TLV of 10 ppm. This is relatively low — the detector must alarm before concentrations reach dangerous levels.`,
    fact: 'R-123 is mildly toxic at high concentrations. ASHRAE 15 requirements exist specifically because a large chiller leak in an enclosed mechanical room can create dangerous conditions quickly.',
