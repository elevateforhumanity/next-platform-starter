            On-the-Job Training (OJT): Get Paid to Train Your New Hires
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-slate-600">
            Every employer trains new hires. The difference is whether you pay for it yourself or
            let the government reimburse you. OJT is a federal program that pays you back for doing
            what you already do — training people to work at your business.
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">What OJT Actually Is</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
              On-the-Job Training is a program under the{' '}
              <strong>Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)</strong> that reimburses
              employers for the cost of training a new employee. The logic is simple: when you hire
              someone who needs skills development, the government recognizes that your time and
              resources have value. OJT compensates you for that investment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
              You are not hiring a &quot;trainee&quot; or an intern. You are hiring a{' '}
              <strong>real employee at a real wage</strong>. They are on your payroll from day one.
              They show up, they work, they learn your systems. The only difference is that WorkOne
              sends you a check for up to 75% of their wages during the training period.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600">
              The training period is typically <strong>3 to 6 months</strong>, depending on the
              complexity of the role. A CNA position might have a 12-week OJT period. An HVAC
              technician might have 6 months. The duration is negotiated upfront in the OJT contract
              based on what the job actually requires.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Why It Exists</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
              The federal government spends billions on workforce development every year. The
              problem they are trying to solve: people who want to work but lack the specific skills
              employers need. OJT bridges that gap by making it financially painless for you to take
              a chance on someone who is trained but not yet experienced in your exact environment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
              This is not charity. This is an economic development tool. The government gets a
              taxpayer off unemployment. You get a trained employee at a fraction of the cost. The
              employee gets a career. Everyone wins.
