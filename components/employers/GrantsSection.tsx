              Elevate is a DOL Registered Apprenticeship Sponsor (RAPIDS: 2025-IN-132301). When you
              host an apprentice, you get a structured training program without building one
              yourself. Elevate provides the Related Technical Instruction (RTI) online. You provide
              the on-the-job training at your worksite.

              Already have employees who need upskilling? Indiana&apos;s ETG program provides grants
              to employers for training <strong>current workers</strong> in high-demand fields. This
              is different from OJT — ETG is for your existing team, not new hires.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3">ETG can cover:</p>
            <ul className="text-sm text-slate-600 space-y-1 mb-3">

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3">
              Worried about hiring someone with a criminal record? The Federal Bonding Program
              provides <strong>free fidelity bonds</strong> that protect your business against
              employee theft or dishonesty for the first 6 months of employment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3">
              This is not insurance you pay for. It is a free bond issued by the U.S. Department of
              Labor. It covers the employee for up to $25,000 with zero cost to you. After 6 months,
              if the employee has performed well, you can purchase a standard commercial bond at
              regular rates.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
              Many of our JRI (Job Ready Indy) graduates qualify. This removes the financial risk of
              hiring from reentry populations while giving people a real second chance.

              WIOA also funds training for workers who are{' '}
              <strong>already employed but need new skills</strong> to avoid layoff or advance in
              their careers. If your industry is changing and your team needs to adapt, IWT can help
              cover the cost.

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-3">
              IWT requires an employer match (typically 10-50% depending on company size), but the
