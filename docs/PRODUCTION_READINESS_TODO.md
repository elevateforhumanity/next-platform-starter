## Why audits find issues but do not “fix everything” in one pass

| Reason | What it means for this repo |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| **Scale** | 1,326 routes, 1,186 API handlers, 685 migrations, 516+ DB tables — no single PR can safely touch all surfaces. |
| **Manual DB steps** | Migrations are **not** auto-applied. Code can ship before Supabase SQL is run; trials/store fail until SQL is applied. |
| **Deploy lag** | Admin/LMS run on Northflank. A merged PR is not live until build + CD completes; admin was 194 commits stale before #330. |
| **Intentional debt** | Dual quiz/course systems, HVAC legacy path, 265 inline auth checks — documented as bounded migration, not delete-on-sight. |
| **Product decisions** | 180 orphan admin pages need per-page keep/delete/nav — not safe to bulk-delete without owner review. |
| **Secrets / runtime** | Lizzy dev container, Stripe webhooks, Supabase service role — need live credentials, not just code. |

**Strategy:** Fix P0 user breaks first → verify deploy SHA → batch P1 wiring → schedule P2 legacy → tune P3 cleanup. Re-run audit commands after each batch.
