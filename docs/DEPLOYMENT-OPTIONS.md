# Deployment Options for Licensees

## How Licensees Use the Platform

When someone licenses Elevate, they have different options depending on their tier:

---

## Self-Serve Plans (Starter / Professional)

### What They Get

- **Hosted SaaS** — We host it, they use it
- **Their own tenant** — Isolated data, their branding
- **Subdomain or custom domain** — e.g., `acme.elevateplatform.com` or `training.acme.org`

### What They Can Customize

- Logo and colors
- Organization name
- Program names and content
- Email templates (limited)
- Landing page copy

### What They Cannot Do

- Access source code
- Self-host
- Modify core functionality
- White-label completely (Elevate branding remains in footer)
- Resell or sublicense

### How It Works

1. They sign up via `/store`
2. Trial starts immediately
3. They configure their tenant via admin dashboard
4. Students access via their subdomain
5. Billing is automatic via Stripe
