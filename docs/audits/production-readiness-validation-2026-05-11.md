# Production Readiness Validation Report
**Date**: 2026-05-11  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Validation Phase**: Comprehensive production verification before final commit

---

## 1. Test Suite Validation Status

### ✅ Vitest (Unit Tests)
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Command**: `pnpm test`
- **Results**:
  - Test Files: 69 passed (69)
  - Tests: 1485 passed (1485)
  - Duration: 144.95 seconds
  - No failures, no warnings
  - All critical suites: ✅ PASSED

**Key Test Categories Verified:**
- Auth guards and permission checks
- License/copyright enforcement
- Security fixes and validations
- Enrollment flow logic
- Portal access control

---

### ⏳ Playwright Integration Tests (E2E)
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS / FAILED (WebServer startup issue)
- **Command**: `pnpm test:e2e tests/smoke.spec.ts --project=chromium`
- **Error**: `Process from config.webServer exited early`
- **Issue**: Dev server initialization timeout
- **Next Action**: Retry with explicit build step, or validate via Supabase schema checks instead

---

### ⏳ Supabase Schema Validation
**PENDING** - To verify:
- [ ] No schema drift between local (supabase/migrations/) and live database
- [ ] All migration files applied successfully
- [ ] Foreign key relationships intact
- [ ] RLS policies correctly enforced
- [ ] Canonical tables exist (`program_holder_verification`, `apprentice_placements`, etc.)

**Critical Tables to Verify:**
```sql
-- Check existence and schema
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'program_holder_verification',
    'apprentice_placements', 
    'program_enrollments',
    'partner_users',
    'programs',
    'profiles'
  );
```

---

### ⏳ Environment Configuration Audit
**PENDING** - To check:
- [ ] Webhook secrets match deployed config (Stripe, SendGrid, custom webhooks)
- [ ] OAuth2 credentials (if applicable) configured in Supabase
- [ ] RLS secrets and API keys properly set
- [ ] Environment variables match across dev/staging/production
- [ ] CRON_SECRET for scheduled tasks
- [ ] API rate limit Redis connection active

**Required Env Vars:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
SENDGRID_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
CRON_SECRET
ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST (optional)
```

---

### ⏳ Deployment Pipeline Validation
**PENDING** - To verify:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy-aws.yml`) syntax valid
- [ ] Docker build succeeds without errors
- [ ] AWS ECR image push completes
- [ ] ECS cluster deployment triggers correctly
- [ ] Rolling update strategy configured (0 downtime)

**Critical Files:**
- `aws/ecs-task-lms.json`
- `aws/ecs-task-admin.json`
- `Dockerfile.package`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml`

---

### ⏳ Race Condition Testing
**PENDING** - Concurrent scenarios to test:
1. **Duplicate Enrollments**: Two concurrent enrollment requests for same user + program
2. **Checkpoint Gating Race**: Submission + checkpoint pass race condition
3. **Parallel Verification**: Simultaneous Stripe Identity + manual verification attempts
4. **Admin Override Race**: Concurrent admin completion override + learner submission
5. **Payment Conflation**: Concurrent payment processing for same order

---

### ⏳ Admin Role & Session Edge Cases
**PENDING** - Scenarios to verify:
1. **Admin Impersonation**: Can admin impersonate learner? Session isolation?
2. **Role Boundary Crossing**: Non-admin accessing `/admin/` routes
3. **Session Expiry**: Expired JWT attempts to protected endpoints
4. **Token Refresh**: Valid refresh token regenerates access token
5. **Multi-Role User**: User with multiple roles gets correct permission set
6. **RLS Policy Bypass**: Verify service_role only bypasses where intentional

---

## 2. Known Risks & Mitigation Status

### Environmental Mismatches
**Risk**: Supabase live schema differs from `supabase/migrations/`

| Migration File | Status | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `20260327000003_checkpoint_gating.sql` | ⏳ VERIFY | Checkpoint gating broken if not applied | Manual verification in Supabase Dashboard |
| `20260401000005_curriculum_lessons_quiz_questions.sql` | ⏳ VERIFY | HVAC quiz data missing | Check `lms_lessons` view reflects `quiz_questions` |
| All 278 migration files | ⏳ AUDIT | Unknown drift | Run schema diff tool |

---

### Schema Drift (Supabase vs Local)
**Risk**: Live database mutations not reflected in migration files

**Potential Issues:**
- New columns added manually without migration file
- Indexes/constraints modified without document update
- RLS policies changed in Dashboard, not committed to repo
- Stored procedures/functions not versioned

**Mitigation**: 
- [ ] Export live schema via Supabase CLI: `supabase db pull`
- [ ] Diff against `supabase/schema.sql`
- [ ] Identify undocumented changes
- [ ] Create missing migration files

---

### Webhook Secret Mismatch
**Risk**: Deployed webhook secrets don't match endpoint handlers

| Webhook | Secret Source | Live Config | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stripe Identity | `.env.local` | ? | Identity verification silently fails |
| Stripe Checkout | `.env.local` | ? | Payments unconfirmed |
| SendGrid | `.env.local` | ? | Emails rejected |
| Custom webhooks | Supabase Edge Function | ? | Requests rejected as unauthorized |

**Verification Required**: Check AWS ECS task definition environment variables

---

### Deployment Pipeline Failures
**Risk**: GitHub Actions workflow breaks during deployment

**Potential Failure Points:**
- Docker base image pull timeout
- Build cache miss → extended build time
- ECR push fails (credentials expired)
- ECS task definition validation fails
- Service update times out (0-downtime strategy issue)

**Mitigation**: 
- [ ] Inspect last 3 GitHub Actions runs for failures
- [ ] Verify ECR credentials in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Validate ECS task definition JSON syntax
- [ ] Check CloudFormation stack health

---

### Race Conditions Under Live Traffic
**Risk**: Concurrent requests cause data corruption or duplicate charges

**High-Risk Scenarios:**
1. **Double Enrollment**: Same user + program enrollment twice = duplicate record
2. **Payment Race**: Concurrent Stripe webhooks for single charge = double capture
3. **Checkpoint Pass Race**: Quick successive quiz submissions bypass gating
4. **Certificate Issuance Race**: Multiple completion triggers = duplicate certificate
5. **Admin Override Race**: Admin + learner actions simultaneously = undefined state

**Mitigation**:
- [ ] Add UNIQUE constraints where needed
- [ ] Use pessimistic locking (FOR UPDATE) on critical transactions
- [ ] Validate idempotency keys on webhook handlers
- [ ] Database triggers enforce business rules

---

### Admin Role / Session Edge Cases
**Risk**: Privilege escalation or session hijacking

| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Admin impersonates learner without audit | Untracked admin actions | `audit_logs` trigger required |
| Non-admin accesses `/admin/` via direct URL | Privilege escalation | Page-level guard + middleware check |
| Expired JWT reused | Session hijacking | `exp` claim validated in middleware |
| Multi-role user gets wrong permission set | Permission escalation | All routes check full role array |
| RLS bypass via direct `service_role` call | Data visibility | Admin client fallback carefully scoped |
