# Platform Audit — 2025

This document captures point-in-time findings, cleanup status, and inventory from platform audits.
These are not standing rules — see AGENTS.md for operating rules.

---

## Completed Cleanup (as of mid-2025)

### Stock Image Replacement

All files with `success-new/` and `students-new/` stock image paths replaced with local workforce images under `public/images/pages/`.

### Template Copy Elimination

- "Access your dashboard" broken copy fixed across 12 files
- "Join thousands who have launched" CTAs eliminated across 87+ files
- 27+ public-facing template pages rewritten with real content
- Auth pages: signin/signup redirect to real forms; forgot/reset-password have real forms
- Funding pages: how-it-works, federal-programs, state-programs, grant-programs rewritten
- Support, training, grievance, forms, orientation pages rewritten
- Admin template CTAs fixed to brand colors across 52 files

### Brand Color Migration

All `blue-*` Tailwind classes migrated to `brand-blue-*` tokens across `app/` and `components/`. Hex values are identical — this enforces naming consistency. Semantic colors (indigo, teal, purple, emerald, cyan) intentionally kept for UI state differentiation.

### Image Overlay Removal

All `bg-black/xx` overlays removed from program and credential cards. Titles moved below images.

### Auth Flow

signin/signup redirect to real forms. `?redirect=` parameter used consistently.

## Tenant Architecture Reference

- `tenants.type` enum: `elevate | partner_provider | employer | workforce_agency`
- `organizations.tenant_id` FK → `tenants` (required for `type = 'training_provider'`)

RLS helpers (all `SECURITY DEFINER`, stable):

| Function                        | Returns                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `get_my_tenant_id()`            | caller's `tenant_id` from profiles  |
| `is_provider_admin()`           | boolean                             |
| `is_case_manager()`             | boolean                             |
| `get_my_assigned_learner_ids()` | UUID[] of assigned learners         |
| `get_my_role()`                 | role string                         |
| `is_admin_role()`               | boolean for admin/super_admin/staff |

## Impersonation

Admin-only. Every session written to `admin_audit_events` (immutable).
Cannot impersonate admin-tier users. Sessions expire after 60 minutes.
UI: `/admin/impersonate`
