## Why This Matters for Funders and Partners

Elevate functions as infrastructure for workforce development — not just a training provider. The platform:

- Qualifies participants for funding at intake
- Delivers structured, credential-aligned training
- Embeds compliance tracking into daily operations
- Connects participants directly to employment pathways
- Reports real workforce outcomes (credential attainment, employment rate, earnings)

This integrated approach reduces administrative burden for workforce agencies while improving participant accountability and outcome visibility.
