- Netlify environment configuration
- DNS and domain configuration
- CDN configuration

## What This Means for Deployment

This repository is **not a deployable copy of the production system**. To run a functional instance you need:

1. A Supabase project with all migrations applied and RLS policies configured
2. A Stripe account with products, prices, and webhooks configured
3. A Resend account with sending domain verified
4. An OpenAI API key
5. A Netlify project with all environment variables set
6. The video asset library (available under managed access or enterprise license)

The codebase is structured so that missing environment variables fail loudly at startup — there is no silent degradation.

## Relationship to Production

The production system at [elevateforhumanity.org](https://www.elevateforhumanity.org) runs from this codebase with:

- All environment variables configured
- Full video and media library
- Live Supabase database with student, enrollment, and compliance data
- Active Stripe integration
- Netlify deployment pipeline (auto-deploy on push to `main`)

Changes to this repository deploy to production automatically. The public repository and the production system are the same codebase.
