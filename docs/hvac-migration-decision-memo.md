# HVAC Content Migration Decision Memo

Generated: 2026-03-17

## Context

The HVAC Technician Program has two parallel content paths:

| Path       | Table                | Rows | Content                                 | Live?   |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Legacy     | `training_lessons`   | 95   | Full — scripts, quizzes, practice exams | **YES** |
| New engine | `curriculum_lessons` | 47   | Empty — title-only skeleton             | NO      |

The legacy path is the only path that serves real learners. The new engine skeleton was created during a curriculum generator run but was never populated with content. Both paths share the same program (`4226f7f6`) and course (`f0593164`) records.

## Parity Audit Results

### Legacy lesson blocks

| Range | Count | Content type                                         |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–10  | 10    | Orientation, safety, tools, HVAC fundamentals        |
| 11–20 | 10    | Electrical, refrigeration basics                     |
| 21–30 | 10    | EPA 608 Core — ozone, regulations, refrigerant types |
| 31–40 | 10    | Recovery/recycling, Type I small appliances          |
| 41–50 | 10    | Type II high-pressure, Type III low-pressure         |
| 51–60 | 10    | Practice exams (Core, Type I, II, III, Universal)    |
| 61–70 | 10    | Installation, commissioning, troubleshooting         |
| 71–76 | 6     | Advanced diagnostics, business skills                |
| 77–84 | 8     | OSHA 30-Hour Construction                            |
| 85–87 | 3     | CPR/First Aid                                        |
| 88–95 | 8     | NRF Rise Up (retail/customer service)                |

### Curriculum_lessons skeleton (new engine)

10 modules, 47 rows. All `script_text` = NULL. No quiz questions. No practice exams.
Module titles are generic (Safety & Tools, HVAC Fundamentals, Refrigeration Basics, etc.) — they do not map 1:1 to the legacy structure.

### Assessment gap

| Assessment type              | Legacy            | Curriculum_lessons             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Module quizzes               | 8 (70% threshold) | 10 checkpoints (80% threshold) |
| Type-specific practice exams | 4 (Core/I/II/III) | 0                              |
| Universal full practice exam | 1                 | 1 (exam type, no questions)    |
| OSHA 30 assessment           | 1                 | 0                              |
| CPR/First Aid assessment     | 1                 | 0                              |

**Pass threshold mismatch:** Legacy = 70% (matches real EPA 608). New engine = 80%. This is a policy inconsistency that must be resolved before activating the new path.

## Decision Table

### KEEP IN LEGACY (do not migrate yet)

| Item                                                          | Reason                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| All 95 `training_lessons` rows                                | Only complete content. Deleting breaks the live course.   |
| Legacy quiz questions (lessons 4, 10, 16, 22, 34, 39, 46, 52) | Validated EPA 608 content. Not replicated in new engine.  |
| Practice exams (lessons 55–59)                                | 5 full-length exams. No equivalent in curriculum_lessons. |
| OSHA 30-Hour block (lessons 77–84)                            | Separate credential. No equivalent in curriculum_lessons. |
| CPR/First Aid block (lessons 85–87)                           | Separate credential. No equivalent in curriculum_lessons. |
| NRF Rise Up block (lessons 88–95)                             | Separate credential. No equivalent in curriculum_lessons. |
| 70% pass threshold                                            | Matches real EPA 608 exam. Do not silently change.        |

### MIGRATE NOW (safe, low-risk)

| Item                                 | Action                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Dead program records                 | ✅ Done — `e5a053ca` and `7e7d355f` deleted        |
| `curriculum_lessons` type annotation | ✅ Done — false `CredentialBlueprint` cast removed |
| Admin curriculum builder warning     | ✅ Done — banner shown for HVAC course             |
| Publish route comment                | ✅ Done — legacy note added                        |

### DEFER (requires deliberate migration project)

| Item                                                                     | Prerequisite before doing                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Populate `curriculum_lessons.script_text` from legacy                    | Full content review + EPA 608 alignment audit                    |
| Migrate practice exams to `step_type='exam'`                             | Decide pass threshold (70% vs 80%)                               |
| Migrate OSHA/CPR/NRF as separate credential blocks                       | Product decision on separate certificate issuance                |
| Switch live learner path from `training_lessons` to `curriculum_lessons` | All above complete + full end-to-end learner simulation          |
| Apply `FORCE ROW SECURITY` on `checkpoint_scores`                        | Migrate `recordCheckpointAttempt` to learner-scoped access first |
| Tighten `lesson_progress` super_admin RLS                                | Replace admin enrollment-deletion workflow first                 |

## Recommended pass threshold

**Use 70% across both paths.** Rationale:

- Matches the actual EPA 608 exam passing standard
- Consistent with the validated legacy quizzes
- 80% is more rigorous but creates a false signal — learners who pass at 80% internally may still fail the real exam, and learners who would pass the real exam at 70% are blocked unnecessarily

When activating the new engine path, update `curriculum_lessons.passing_score` for all HVAC checkpoints from 80 to 70.

---

## What must not happen

- Do not delete `training_lessons` for HVAC without completing the full migration
- Do not route learners to `curriculum_lessons` path until all 95 lessons are populated
- Do not change the pass threshold without an explicit decision recorded here
- Do not add OSHA/CPR/NRF to the new engine without deciding whether they issue separate certificates
