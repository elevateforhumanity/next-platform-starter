My name is Elizabeth Greene and I am the Executive Director of Elevate for Humanity, a workforce development organization focused on building career pathways in healthcare, skilled trades, and technical fields.

We are launching a Certified Nurse Aide training pathway in partnership with an approved nurse aide training program and are currently seeking long-term care partners interested in hosting CNA clinical training for our students.

Elevate for Humanity works with multiple national credentialing and workforce training organizations including Certiport, CareerSafe, JobReady, Milady, and ServSafe. Our mission is to provide industry-recognized credentials and connect individuals with meaningful employment opportunities.

Our CNA students complete their academic instruction online and then perform required hands-on clinical training under RN supervision at partner healthcare facilities. Through this partnership, Greenwood Village South would receive priority access to trained graduates ready for employment.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss hosting clinical rotations and building a long-term workforce partnership with your facility.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

My name is Elizabeth Greene and I serve as Executive Director of Elevate for Humanity, a workforce training organization dedicated to expanding career pathways in healthcare and other high-demand industries.

We are currently launching a Certified Nurse Aide training cohort in partnership with an approved nurse aide training program and are seeking clinical training partners in the Indianapolis area.
