If you're watching this, you've been approved as a Program Holder in our Training Network — and we're glad to have you.

This video covers everything you need to know before you begin: how the platform works, what the handbook requires, how students are managed, how you get paid, and what your rights are.

Watch it fully. The handbook acknowledgement at the end is legally binding.`,

    text: `Elevate for Humanity is a workforce development organization based in Indianapolis, Indiana.

We provide career training, credentialing, and job placement support to job seekers, returning citizens, veterans, and underserved communities.

We operate as an Eligible Training Provider under Indiana's INTraining system — administered by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development.

This means our programs qualify for WIOA funding and the Workforce Ready Grant. Most students pay zero out of pocket.

When you deliver training under the Elevate name, you are an authorized delivery site within our Training Network. Elevate owns the programs, the curriculum, the credentials, and the brand. You provide the space, the students, or the coordination — depending on your tier.`,

Students access their coursework, complete quizzes, track attendance, and earn credentials entirely through the platform.

As a Program Holder, you have your own dashboard at elevateforhumanity.org — under Program Holder.

From your dashboard you can view enrolled students, track their progress, submit attendance records, upload required documents, view your payment status, and access the handbook and compliance materials.

You do not manage student accounts directly. All enrollment, credentialing, and record-keeping is handled by Elevate. Your job is to support students at your site and keep your records current.

If you ever have trouble accessing the platform, contact your assigned Elevate coordinator immediately.`,

The handbook covers six things you must understand before you begin.

First: your role. What you are responsible for — student recruitment, WorkOne registration, attendance tracking, facility readiness, and communication.

Second: required documents. You cannot enroll students or receive payments until all required documents are submitted and approved. This includes your business license, training provider license, facility inspection certificate, instructor credentials, liability insurance, workers compensation insurance, background checks, your federal EIN, a W-9, and approved curriculum confirmation.

Third: student management. All students are Elevate students. Student records are protected under FERPA. You may not share student information with any third party without written authorization.

Fourth: compliance. These are federal WIOA requirements and Indiana state law. They are not negotiable.

Fifth: confidentiality and non-compete. What you learn about our curriculum, pricing, and operations is confidential. You may not replicate the program model.

Sixth: your right to exit. You can leave at any time with 30 days written notice. No reason required.

Read every section before you acknowledge.`,

    text: `This is one of the most important compliance requirements — and one of the most commonly missed.

Every student seeking WIOA funding must be registered through WorkOne before enrollment begins. This is a federal requirement. It is not optional.

WorkOne is Indiana's workforce development system. Students register at IndianaCareerConnect.com, schedule an appointment with their local WorkOne office, and receive a training voucher before their tuition can be funded.

If a student begins training before completing WorkOne registration, their funding may be denied — and you may be responsible for the gap.

Do not enroll WIOA-funded students without confirmed WorkOne registration. If you are unsure, contact your Elevate coordinator before proceeding.`,

Tier One is the Facility Host tier. You provide a dedicated physical training space and on-site operational support. You receive one-third of net program revenue per cohort. Payments are split: fifty percent at the midpoint of the program, and fifty percent when the student earns their credential. For a ten-student barber cohort, that's approximately eighteen thousand dollars. For fifty students, approximately ninety thousand.

Tier Two is the Coordination Partner tier. You provide student coordination and supervision support — no facility required. You receive fifteen percent of net program revenue.

Tier Three is the Referral Partner tier. You refer eligible individuals to Elevate programs. You receive a flat fee of two hundred fifty to five hundred dollars per enrolled student. No operational responsibility.

Net revenue is gross tuition minus direct program costs — credential exam fees, LMS, curriculum, marketing, compliance, administration, and student services.

Payments are processed within thirty days of invoice approval. Invoices must include supporting documentation.`,
