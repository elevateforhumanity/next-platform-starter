        question:
          'Which complementary color is used to neutralize yellow brassiness in lightened hair?',
        options: ['Red', 'Orange', 'Violet', 'Green'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Violet is directly opposite yellow on the color wheel. Complementary colors cancel each other out, so violet toners neutralize yellow brassiness in lightened or highlighted hair.',

        options: ['Black', 'Dark brown', 'Medium brown', 'Light blonde'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Level 5 is dark brown on the 1–10 hair color level system. Level 1 is black; level 10 is the lightest blonde.',

        options: ['Temporary', 'Semi-permanent', 'Demi-permanent', 'Permanent'],
        correctAnswer: 3,
        explanation:
          'Permanent color uses a developer (hydrogen peroxide) to open the cuticle, allowing the color to penetrate the cortex and permanently change the hair. It can both lighten and deposit color.',

        options: ['Semi-permanent', 'Demi-permanent', 'Permanent with developer', 'Temporary'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Only permanent color with developer can lighten hair. Semi-permanent and demi-permanent cannot lighten significantly. Temporary color only coats the cuticle. Going from level 6 to level 9 requires permanent color with an appropriate developer volume.',

        question: 'Semi-permanent color differs from temporary color in which key way?',
        options: [
          'Semi-permanent requires a developer; temporary does not',
          'Semi-permanent lasts 4–6 weeks and penetrates slightly into the cuticle; temporary washes out in 1–2 shampoos',
          'Semi-permanent can lighten hair; temporary cannot',
          'There is no difference — both wash out completely',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Semi-permanent color penetrates slightly into the cuticle layer and lasts 4–6 weeks. Temporary color only coats the outside of the cuticle and washes out in 1–2 shampoos. Neither requires a developer and neither can lighten hair.',

        options: ['Violet', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Blue is directly opposite orange on the color wheel. Blue-based toners neutralize orange brassiness. Violet neutralizes yellow. Understanding complementary color relationships is essential for corrective color work.',

          '72 hours before',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'A patch test must be performed 24–48 hours before any chemical service. Allergic reactions can take up to 48 hours to develop. Performing the test the same day does not allow enough time to detect a delayed reaction.',

        question: 'Why are nitrile gloves required for chemical services rather than latex gloves?',
        options: [
          'Nitrile gloves are thicker and more durable',
          'Latex gloves are not adequate because chemicals can permeate latex',
          'Nitrile gloves are required by Indiana law specifically',
          'Latex gloves cause allergic reactions in all clients',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          "Many chemical service products can permeate latex gloves, exposing the barber's skin to harmful chemicals. Nitrile gloves provide a chemical-resistant barrier. Additionally, some clients and barbers have latex allergies, making nitrile the safer choice.",

          'A patch test shows redness and swelling at 24 hours. What is the correct action?',
        options: [
          'Proceed — mild redness is normal and will resolve',
          'Wait another 24 hours and recheck before deciding',
          'Do not proceed — any reaction is a contraindication',
          'Use a lower-strength product and proceed with caution',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Any reaction — redness, swelling, itching, or burning — is a contraindication. There is no threshold of "acceptable" reaction. Proceeding after a positive patch test risks a severe allergic reaction on the client\'s scalp.',

          'Nitrile gloves, protective apron, and eye protection',
          'Nitrile gloves and a face mask only',
          'Eye protection only — gloves are optional for experienced barbers',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'All three items are required: nitrile gloves (chemical-resistant barrier for hands), protective apron (protects clothing and skin from splashes), and eye protection (chemical splashes can cause serious eye injury). No PPE item is optional.',

          'A client had a chemical service 3 weeks ago and wants another. What is the correct response?',
        options: [
          'Proceed — 3 weeks is sufficient recovery time',
          'Decline — chemical services should be spaced at least 4 weeks apart',
          'Perform a patch test and proceed if negative',
          "Proceed only if the client's hair appears healthy",
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Chemical services should be spaced at least 4 weeks apart to allow the hair and scalp to recover. Overlapping chemical services causes cumulative damage to the hair structure and scalp. 3 weeks is insufficient — the service should be declined.',

          'On the back of the hand',
          'On the forearm only',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'The patch test is applied behind the ear or inside the elbow — areas with thin, sensitive skin that are representative of scalp skin reactivity. The back of the hand has thicker skin and is not a reliable test site.',

        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'Why is ventilation required during chemical services?',
        options: [
          'To prevent the product from drying too quickly',
          'Chemical fumes can cause respiratory irritation and are a health hazard',
          'Ventilation is only required for bleach services, not color',
          'To maintain the correct processing temperature',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Chemical service products release fumes that can cause respiratory irritation, headaches, and in high concentrations, more serious health effects. Adequate ventilation protects both the barber and the client. This is an OSHA requirement in professional settings.',

          'A client has a small scalp abrasion from scratching. What is the correct action before a chemical service?',
        options: [
          'Apply petroleum jelly to the abrasion and proceed',
          'Decline the service — scalp abrasions are a contraindication for chemical services',
          'Proceed if the abrasion is small and not actively bleeding',
          'Apply antiseptic to the abrasion and wait 10 minutes before proceeding',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Scalp abrasions are a contraindication for chemical services. Chemicals applied to broken skin cause severe burning, chemical burns, and potential systemic absorption. The service must be declined until the scalp has fully healed.',

        question: 'What chemical bonds do relaxers break to straighten hair?',
        options: ['Hydrogen bonds', 'Salt bonds', 'Disulfide bonds', 'Peptide bonds'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Relaxers break the disulfide bonds in the cortex — the strongest bonds in the hair structure. These bonds give hair its curl pattern. Breaking them allows the hair to be restructured in a straighter form. The neutralizer re-forms the bonds in the new position.',

        question: 'What is the critical safety rule before applying a relaxer?',
        options: [
          'Shampoo the hair thoroughly immediately before application',
          'Never apply to a scratched, irritated, or broken scalp',
          'Always perform a strand test on the day of service',
          'Apply relaxer to wet hair only',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Never apply a relaxer to a scratched, irritated, or broken scalp. Relaxer chemicals on broken skin cause severe chemical burns. Clients should be instructed not to scratch their scalp for 48 hours before a relaxer service.',
      },
      {
        id: 'mod6-l37-q3',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'What is the difference between a relaxer and a texturizer?',
        options: [
          'They use different chemicals — relaxers use lye, texturizers use no-lye',
          'A texturizer uses the same chemistry as a relaxer but with a shorter processing time, loosening curl without fully straightening',
          'Texturizers are permanent; relaxers are semi-permanent',
          'There is no difference — texturizer is just a marketing term for relaxer',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A texturizer uses the same chemistry as a relaxer (sodium hydroxide or guanidine) but is processed for a shorter time. This loosens the curl pattern without fully straightening the hair. The result is a softer, more manageable curl rather than straight hair.',

        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question:
          'Why must relaxer be applied to new growth only and not overlapped onto previously relaxed hair?',
        options: [
          'Overlapping causes the color to change',
          'Overlapping causes over-processing — the previously relaxed hair breaks because it cannot withstand additional chemical processing',
          'Overlapping is acceptable if the previously relaxed hair is healthy',
          'Overlapping causes the relaxer to stop working on the new growth',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Previously relaxed hair has already had its disulfide bonds broken and re-formed. Applying relaxer again over-processes the hair, breaking bonds that have already been restructured and causing severe breakage. New growth only is a non-negotiable rule.',

        question: 'What is the purpose of basing the scalp with petroleum jelly before a relaxer?',
        options: [
          'It helps the relaxer penetrate the scalp for better results',
          'It creates a protective barrier between the relaxer and the scalp skin',
          'It is required only for lye relaxers, not no-lye',
          'It prevents the relaxer from processing too quickly',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Petroleum jelly creates a protective barrier on the scalp skin, reducing the risk of chemical burns from the relaxer. It does not prevent the relaxer from working on the hair shaft. Basing is required for all relaxer types.',

        question: 'What happens if a relaxer is not neutralized thoroughly?',
        options: [
          'The hair reverts to its natural curl pattern',
          'The chemical process continues, causing ongoing damage and breakage',
          'The hair becomes over-conditioned and limp',
          'The relaxer oxidizes and changes color',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          "The neutralizer stops the relaxer process by restoring the hair's pH and re-forming bonds in the new position. Insufficient neutralizing means the chemical process continues after the client leaves, causing progressive damage and breakage.",

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'No-lye (guanidine) relaxers are gentler on the scalp but can leave calcium deposits on the hair shaft over time. These deposits make hair feel dry and brittle. A chelating shampoo removes mineral buildup and is recommended with regular no-lye relaxer use.',

          'Reduce the remaining processing time by half and then rinse',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Burning during relaxer processing is a sign of scalp irritation or chemical burn beginning. The relaxer must be rinsed immediately and thoroughly. Continuing to process risks a serious chemical burn. The scalp must be assessed after rinsing.',
