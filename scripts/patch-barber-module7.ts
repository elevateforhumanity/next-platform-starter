        question: 'What is the most effective way to build a loyal clientele as a new barber?',
        options: [
          'Offer the lowest prices in the area',
          'Deliver consistent quality, follow up with clients, and ask for referrals',
          'Post on social media daily',
          'Work at the busiest shop regardless of fit',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Consistent quality builds trust. Follow-up (a text reminder, a thank-you) shows professionalism. Referrals from satisfied clients are the highest-conversion source of new business. Price-cutting attracts price-sensitive clients who leave when someone cheaper opens nearby.',

        question: 'A client has not returned in 8 weeks. What is the most appropriate action?',
        options: [
          'Do nothing — clients return when they are ready',
          'Send a brief, professional re-engagement message offering to book their next appointment',
          'Offer a discount to win them back',
          'Ask other clients why they think the client stopped coming',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A brief, professional re-engagement message is appropriate and shows the client they are valued. Discounts train clients to wait for deals. Doing nothing means losing the client permanently. Asking other clients is unprofessional.',

        question: 'Which booking system practice most reduces no-shows?',
        options: [
          'Requiring a credit card to hold appointments',
          'Sending automated appointment reminders 24 hours before',
          'Charging a no-show fee after the fact',
          'Only accepting walk-ins',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Automated reminders 24 hours before significantly reduce no-shows by keeping the appointment top of mind. Credit card holds and no-show fees are effective but can deter new clients. Walk-ins eliminate the no-show problem but reduce scheduling efficiency.',

        question: 'What information should a barber collect from every new client?',
        options: [
          'Name and phone number only',
          'Name, contact information, service preferences, and any scalp or skin conditions',
          'Name, address, and employer',
          'No information — collecting data creates liability',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A client intake record should include contact information for booking and follow-up, service preferences for consistency, and any scalp or skin conditions that affect service decisions. This is both a business and a safety practice.',

        question:
          'A satisfied client offers to refer friends. What is the most professional response?',
        options: [
          'Tell them referrals are not necessary',
          'Thank them sincerely and give them a few business cards to share',
          'Offer them a cash payment for each referral',
          'Ask them to post a review online instead',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Thanking the client and providing business cards is professional and actionable. Cash payments for referrals can feel transactional and may violate shop policies. Online reviews are valuable but are a separate ask — do not redirect a referral offer.',

        question: "How does a barber's personal brand affect clientele building?",
        options: [
          'Personal brand is irrelevant — only technical skill matters',
          'A consistent personal brand (appearance, communication style, social presence) attracts clients who align with that brand and increases retention',
          'Personal brand only matters for platform artists, not shop barbers',
          "Personal brand is the same as the shop's brand",
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          "A barber's personal brand — how they present themselves, communicate, and show up online — attracts clients who identify with that brand. Clients who align with a barber's brand are more loyal and more likely to refer others.",

        question: 'What is the primary purpose of a client consultation before every service?',
        options: [
          'To upsell additional services',
          "To confirm the client's desired result and identify any contraindications before touching the client",
          "To fill time while the previous client's hair dries",
          'To document the service for billing purposes',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'The consultation confirms what the client wants, identifies any scalp or skin conditions that affect the service, and sets expectations. It prevents misunderstandings and is a safety checkpoint. It is not primarily a sales tool.',

          'Posting only when inspiration strikes',
          'Focusing exclusively on follower count over engagement',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
          "Before-and-after photos of real work are the most effective content for barbers because they demonstrate skill directly to potential clients. Consistency matters more than frequency. Reposting others' work does not showcase personal skill.",

        question:
          "In a booth rental arrangement, who is responsible for paying taxes on the barber's income?",
        options: [
          'The shop owner',
          'The barber, as an independent contractor',
          'The state licensing board',
          'Taxes are split equally between the barber and shop owner',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A booth renter is an independent contractor. They are responsible for their own taxes, including self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare). The shop owner does not withhold taxes. This is a significant financial responsibility that new barbers must plan for.',
      },
      {
        id: 'mod7-l41-q2',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'What is the primary advantage of a commission arrangement for a new barber?',
        options: [
          'Higher income potential than booth rental',
          'Predictable income structure with the shop handling taxes and overhead',
          'Complete control over scheduling and pricing',
          'No obligation to follow shop policies',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Commission arrangements provide a more predictable income structure for new barbers. The shop handles overhead (rent, utilities, supplies) and withholds taxes. The trade-off is lower income potential compared to booth rental once a barber builds a strong clientele.',
      },
      {
        id: 'mod7-l41-q3',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'A booth renter wants to raise their prices. Who must approve this decision?',
        options: [
          'The shop owner must approve all price changes',
          'The barber decides independently — they set their own prices as an independent contractor',
          'The state licensing board sets maximum prices',
          'Prices must match all other barbers in the shop',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A booth renter is an independent contractor and sets their own prices. The shop owner cannot legally control the prices of an independent contractor. This is one of the key distinctions between booth rental and employment.',

        question:
          'Which business structure provides the most personal liability protection for a barber who owns a shop?',
        options: [
          'Sole proprietorship',
          'General partnership',
          'Limited Liability Company (LLC)',
          'Independent contractor status',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'An LLC separates personal assets from business liabilities. If the business is sued, personal assets (home, savings) are generally protected. A sole proprietorship provides no such separation — the owner is personally liable for all business debts and lawsuits.',
      },

        question: 'What does a booth rental agreement typically specify?',

          "The shop owner's right to set the barber's prices",
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A booth rental agreement is a contract between the shop owner and the independent contractor barber. It specifies rent, payment terms, shop rules the barber must follow (hours, cleanliness), and the notice period required to end the arrangement.',

        options: ['$500', '$750', '$1,000', '$2,000'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          "50% of $2,000 = $1,000 gross pay. The shop retains the other $1,000 to cover overhead (rent, utilities, supplies, insurance). The barber's take-home is $1,000 minus applicable taxes withheld by the employer.",

        question: 'Which arrangement gives a barber the most control over their schedule?',
        options: ['Commission employment', 'Booth rental', 'Salary employment', 'Apprenticeship'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          "Booth renters set their own schedules as independent contractors. Commission and salary employees work within the shop's required hours. Apprentices follow their sponsor's schedule. Control over scheduling is one of the primary reasons experienced barbers choose booth rental.",
      },

        id: 'mod7-l41-q8',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'What is the main financial risk of booth rental compared to commission?',
        options: [
          'Booth renters pay higher taxes',
          'Booth renters must pay rent regardless of how much they earn that week',
          'Booth renters cannot build a clientele',
          'Booth renters are required to purchase all shop supplies',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Booth rent is a fixed cost due regardless of revenue. In a slow week, the barber still owes rent. Commission barbers only pay the shop when they earn — if they earn nothing, they owe nothing. This makes booth rental higher-risk for barbers without an established clientele.',

        options: ['$240', '$900', '$1,200', '$1,500'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:

        options: ['7.65%', '15.3%', '25%', '30%'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Self-employment tax is 15.3% (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare) on net self-employment income. Employees pay half this rate because employers pay the other half. Self-employed barbers pay both halves. Setting aside at least 25-30% total (including income tax) is a common recommendation.',

        options: ['15%', '20%', '25%', '30%'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          '$7 ÷ $35 = 0.20 = 20%. The standard tip range for barber services is 15-20%. Understanding tip percentages helps barbers track their service quality and client satisfaction.',

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Professional tools and supplies used for work (clippers, guards, disinfectants, capes) are deductible business expenses. Personal expenses are not deductible. A barber should keep receipts for all business purchases and consult a tax professional.',

        options: [
          'It is required by the state licensing board',
          'It allows the barber to identify trends, set pricing, and plan for slow periods',
          'It is only necessary for shop owners, not individual barbers',
          'It is used to calculate tips owed to assistants',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Tracking daily revenue reveals patterns — busy days, slow seasons, which services generate the most income. This data drives pricing decisions, scheduling, and financial planning. Every self-employed barber should track revenue regardless of their arrangement.',

        options: ['$400', '$800', '$1,000', '$1,400'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          '$1,400 revenue − $400 booth rent = $1,000 gross profit before taxes and other expenses. This is not take-home pay — taxes and any other business expenses (supplies, insurance) are still deducted from this amount.',

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'A consistently full schedule is the clearest signal that demand exceeds supply — the market will support a higher price. Raising prices when booked out reduces the time spent on lower-margin clients and increases revenue per hour.',

        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Professional ethics require staying current. Techniques evolve, safety standards are updated, and regulations change. A barber who stops learning after licensure risks providing outdated or unsafe services. Many states also require continuing education for license renewal.',

        question:
          'A client requests a service that you believe will damage their hair. What is the ethical approach?',
        options: [
          'Perform the service — the client has the right to make their own decisions',
          'Refuse the service without explanation',
          'Inform the client of the risk, document the conversation, and proceed only if they give informed consent',
          'Perform a different service without telling the client',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Informed consent is an ethical requirement. The barber must inform the client of the risk clearly. If the client understands and still wants the service, they may proceed — the client has autonomy over their own hair. Performing a different service without consent is a violation of that autonomy.',

        question: 'Which practice demonstrates professional ethics regarding sanitation?',
        options: [
          'Skipping disinfection between clients when the schedule is busy',
          'Maintaining full sanitation protocols for every client regardless of time pressure',

          'Disinfecting tools at the end of the day rather than between clients',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Sanitation protocols are non-negotiable regardless of schedule pressure. Every client deserves the same standard of care. Skipping or shortcutting sanitation is an ethical violation and a public health risk — not a time management strategy.',

        question: 'Which product type provides the strongest hold with a matte finish?',
        options: ['Pomade (water-based)', 'Clay or paste', 'Gel', 'Light cream'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Clay and paste products provide strong hold with a matte or low-sheen finish. They are ideal for textured, natural-looking styles. Gel provides strong hold but with a wet or shiny finish. Pomade varies by formulation. Light creams provide minimal hold.',
      },
      {
        id: 'mod7-l44-q2',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question:
          'A client wants a high-shine, slicked-back style with medium hold. Which product is most appropriate?',
        options: ['Matte clay', 'Water-based pomade', 'Dry texture spray', 'Sea salt spray'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Water-based pomade provides medium-to-strong hold with a high-shine finish — ideal for slicked-back styles. It is also water-soluble, making it easy to wash out. Oil-based pomade provides more shine but is harder to remove.',

      {
        id: 'mod7-l44-q3',
        type: 'multiple_choice',
        question: 'What is the advantage of water-based pomade over oil-based pomade?',
        options: [
          'Water-based provides more shine',
          'Water-based is easier to wash out and does not build up as quickly',
          'Water-based provides stronger hold',
          'There is no practical difference',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Water-based pomade washes out easily with water and shampoo. Oil-based pomade requires multiple shampoos to remove and can build up on the scalp over time. For clients who shampoo daily, water-based is the practical choice.',

        options: ['Gel', 'Heavy pomade', 'Dry texture spray or powder', 'Leave-in conditioner'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Dry texture sprays and powders add texture and volume by roughening the hair cuticle slightly. They add no weight and no shine — ideal for fine hair that needs lift or for styles that require a natural, undone texture.',

          'Volumizing mousse',
          'Light cream',
          'Heavy pomade or oil-based products',
          'Dry texture spray',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'Heavy pomades and oil-based products weigh down fine hair, making it appear flatter and thinner. Fine hair needs lightweight products that add texture and volume without adding weight. Volumizing mousse, light creams, and dry texture sprays are appropriate choices.',

        question: 'When should styling product be applied during a haircut service?',
        options: [
          'Before the haircut to control the hair during cutting',
          'After the haircut is complete and the hair is in its final form',
          'During the haircut to check the finished look',
          'Product application is optional and depends on client preference',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          'Styling product is applied after the haircut is complete. Applying product before or during the cut can interfere with the cutting process, cause the hair to clump, and make it difficult to see the true length and texture.',

          'Tell them fades do not require product maintenance',
          'Recommend the most expensive product in the shop',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
          "A professional recommendation based on the client's specific hair type and desired result demonstrates expertise and builds trust. It also creates a retail opportunity. Generic advice or upselling without basis undermines credibility.",

        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation:
          'A matte cream or light paste provides light-to-medium hold with no shine, producing a natural-looking finish. Oil-based pomade and gel both add shine. Hairspray provides hold but is typically used as a finishing spray over other products.',
