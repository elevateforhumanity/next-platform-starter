Straight Razor — used for shaving and edging, blade must be replaced between clients. Combs — nonporous, must be disinfected between clients. Brushes — neck brush and cleaning brush, disinfect between clients.\n\nClipper blade maintenance: Turn off and unplug. Brush all visible hair from the blade. Apply clipper disinfectant spray — keep blade visibly wet for full contact time. Allow to dry before reuse. Oil the blade lightly after disinfection to prevent rust.\n\nStraight razor blades must be replaced between every client. A used blade is a single-use item.',
