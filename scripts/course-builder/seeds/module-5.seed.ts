        'Proper preparation softens the beard, opens the pores, and reduces razor drag — preventing irritation and ingrown hairs. A well-prepared face requires fewer passes, which means less irritation and a closer result.\n\nHot towel application: Soak a clean towel in hot water. Test temperature on your wrist before applying to the client. Wring out excess water. Apply to the face for 2–3 minutes. Remove and apply pre-shave oil or cream.\n\nPre-shave products: Pre-shave oil — lubricates and protects the skin, applied before lather. Shaving cream — creates a protective lather, most common in barbershops. Shaving soap — traditional, requires a brush to build lather.\n\nContraindications — do not proceed if: client has open cuts, active acne, inflamed bumps, rash, or infection on the face; client reports sensitivity to heat or products; skin condition makes shaving unsafe.',

        'Blade safety — non-negotiable: Shavette blades are single-use. Replace between every client. Dispose of used blades in a puncture-resistant sharps container immediately after use. Never recap a used blade with your fingers.\n\nRazor angle: Hold the razor at a 30-degree angle to the skin. Too steep (above 45°) causes cuts. Too flat (below 15°) causes drag and ineffective cutting. Maintain consistent angle throughout each stroke.\n\nThe three-pass shave: First pass — with the grain (WTG): follow the direction of hair growth, removes most of the beard, safest pass. Second pass — across the grain (XTG): cut perpendicular to growth, closer result. Third pass — against the grain (ATG): closest shave, only for clients with no sensitivity.\n\nSkin stretching: Use your free hand to keep the skin taut at all times. Loose skin causes nicks and uneven shaving. Stretch in the direction opposite to the razor stroke.\n\nStroke technique: Use short, controlled strokes. Rinse the blade after every 2–3 strokes. Never drag the razor — let the blade do the work.\n\nBlood exposure protocol: Stop service immediately. Put on gloves before touching the affected area. Apply antiseptic (alum block or styptic) to the nick. Dispose of all contaminated single-use materials in a sealed bag. Clean and disinfect blood-contaminated tools. Double-bag contaminated waste. Wash hands thoroughly after removing gloves.',
