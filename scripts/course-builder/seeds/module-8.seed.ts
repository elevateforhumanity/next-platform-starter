        'Exam components: Written exam — 100 multiple choice questions, 75% passing score required, administered by PSI/NIC. Practical exam — performed on a mannequin or live model, graded by state board examiners.\n\nWritten exam topic weights: Infection control & sanitation 25%. Hair science & scalp analysis 20%. Haircutting & styling 25%. Chemical services 15%. Indiana laws & regulations 15%.\n\nPractical exam skills: Haircut with fade — clean fade with smooth transitions, no visible lines. Shave service — correct angle, grain direction, and skin tension. Sanitation procedures — pre-clean → disinfect → contact time, tested in sequence. Client draping — neck strip before cape, cape must not contact bare skin.\n\nApprenticeship vs. school path: School path requires 1,500 hours. Apprenticeship path (this program) requires 2,000 OJT hours. Both paths require the same written and practical exams.',

        'Key sanitation facts: Between-client requirement is disinfection — not sterilization. Disinfectant type must be EPA-registered. Sharps disposal requires a puncture-resistant sharps container — never regular trash. Solution must be changed daily or when visibly contaminated. Tinea capitis — no service, refer to physician immediately. Pre-clean rule — remove debris before applying disinfectant, debris blocks effectiveness.\n\nKey hair science facts: Cortex contains melanin (color) and keratin (strength). Anagen phase is active growth lasting 2–7 years. Normal daily hair loss is 50–100 hairs per day. High porosity means damaged cuticle — absorbs quickly, loses moisture fast. Patch test timing is 24–48 hours before chemical services.\n\nInfection control is the single largest topic on the written exam at 25%. Know the disinfection sequence (pre-clean → disinfect → contact time → store), the difference between sanitation/disinfection/sterilization, and all blood exposure protocol steps.',

        "Key technique facts: Parietal ridge is the widest part of head and high fade reference point. Occipital bone is at the back of skull and low/mid fade reference point. Razor angle is 30 degrees. Neckline placement is two finger-widths above the Adam's apple. First shave pass goes with the grain (WTG). Thinning shears remove bulk without changing length.\n\nKey Indiana law facts: Apprenticeship OJT hours — 2,000. School hours — 1,500. Written exam passing score — 75%. License renewal — every 2 years. License display — must be displayed at the workstation. Governing law — Indiana Code Title 25, Article 8.\n\nCommon exam traps: Sterilization vs. disinfection — barbershops require disinfection, not sterilization. Apprenticeship hours (2,000) vs. school hours (1,500) — frequently confused. Written exam passing score is 75%, not 70%. Module checkpoints use 70%.",

        'What examiners look for: Draping — neck strip placed before cape, cape does not contact bare skin. Sanitation — pre-clean → disinfect → contact time, sequence must be correct. Fade — clean fade line, smooth transitions, no visible blend lines. Lineup — sharp, even edges, natural hairline preserved. Shave — correct angle (30°), skin tension maintained, correct grain direction. Demeanor — professional throughout, no rushing, no unsafe tool handling.\n\nPractice checklist — run this before every practice session: Drape client correctly with neck strip and cape. Disinfect all tools before beginning — pre-clean first, then disinfect, then maintain contact time. Establish fade line and work upward with progressively larger guards. Blend all transitions — check from multiple angles, no visible lines. Execute clean lineup at hairline, temples, and nape. Perform shave with correct angle and grain direction. Apply post-shave care. Clean and disinfect station after service.\n\nExaminers are not trying to fail you — they are verifying that you are safe to practice on the public.
