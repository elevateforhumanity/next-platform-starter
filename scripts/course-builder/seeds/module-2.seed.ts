        'The hair shaft has three layers. Cuticle: outermost layer — overlapping scales that protect the cortex, determines shine and porosity. Cortex: middle layer — contains melanin (color) and keratin (strength). Medulla: inner core — not always present, more common in coarse hair.\n\nThe scalp has five layers: skin, connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, and periosteum. Hair follicles are embedded in the dermis. Each follicle produces one hair strand. Sebaceous glands produce sebum, which lubricates the hair and scalp.',
