        "Clients decide within the first 30 seconds whether they will return. Be on time, be clean, be professional. Your station reflects your standards — a clean, organized station signals competence before you pick up a tool.\n\nRetention strategies: Remember names — use the client's name during the service. Client card — keep notes on style, products used, and last visit, review before each appointment. Follow up — a text after a new client's first visit goes a long way. Rebook — recommend the next appointment before they leave the chair.\n\nSocial media: Post your work consistently. Before-and-after photos with client permission are the most effective content. Use local hashtags and tag your shop location. Respond to comments and DMs promptly.\n\nEvery client who leaves without a next appointment is a client you may lose. Recommend rebooking at the end of every service.",

        'Business models: Commission — work for the shop owner, receive 40–60% of service revenue, shop provides clients, supplies, and equipment, good for new barbers. Booth rental — pay a weekly or monthly fee to use a chair, keep 100% of service revenue, self-employed and responsible for taxes, supplies, and clients. Shop ownership — own the business, maximum income potential, maximum responsibility, requires business license, shop license, and startup capital.\n\nTypical career path: Most barbers start on commission to build skills and clientele. Move to booth rental when clientele is strong enough to cover the booth fee and generate profit. Consider ownership after 5+ years of experience and a solid client base.\n\nBooth renters are self-employed. You pay both the employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes — approximately 15.3% on top of income tax. Set aside 25–30% of gross income for taxes.',

Raise prices as your clientele grows.\n\nTipping: The standard tip for barbering is 15–20%. Never expect a tip but always appreciate one. Make it easy — have a tip jar or use a payment system that prompts for tips.\n\nFinancial basics for self-employed barbers: Track all income — cash and card, every dollar must be reported.
