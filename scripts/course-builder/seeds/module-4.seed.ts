        'Fade types: Low fade — starts just above the ear and nape, conservative and professional. Mid fade — starts at the temple, versatile and most requested. High fade — starts at the parietal ridge, bold and dramatic. Skin fade (bald fade) — goes to bare skin, requires #0 or foil shaver.\n\nFade technique: Establish the fade line with a #1 or #2. Work upward with progressively larger guards. Use the open/close lever to blend between guard sizes. Blend with a flicking motion at each transition. Check for lines from all angles and blend until smooth.\n\nPre-service sanitation: Pre-clean clipper blades before applying disinfectant spray. Use clipper disinfectant spray — keep blades visibly wet for full contact time per label. Disinfect workstation and chair after each client.\n\nStop conditions: Stop service immediately if you observe open cuts or broken skin, signs of scalp infection or inflammation, client reports pain, or clipper malfunction or overheating.',

        "A lineup is a finishing service. Its job is to sharpen the front hairline, temples, sideburn edges, around the ears, and nape. The barber's rule: define what is already there. Do not invent a new hairline unless the service plan clearly calls for it.\n\nContraindications — do not use razor over: cuts, abrasions, or open skin; active acne or inflamed bumps; rash or infection; skin that is already irritated; areas prone to keloid scarring.\n\nService order: Front hairline → temples → around ears → sideburns → nape → symmetry check → razor detailing if appropriate.\n\nProcedure: Establish the front hairline at center and work outward. Use light pressure and short controlled motions. Remove only overgrowth — do not push the line back. Shape the temples based on haircut, growth pattern, and client preference. Outline around the ears with short controlled movements. Balance the sideburns — check from the front, not only from the side. Create the nape outline per client preference. Check symmetry from the front view. Razor detailing if skin is healthy: apply lather, stretch skin firmly, hold razor at low angle with light pressure, use short controlled strokes.\n\nPre-service sanitation: Wash or sanitize hands. Pre-clean all tools. Apply EPA-registered disinfectant and maintain full contact time. Use clipper disinfectant spray on trimmer blades with full contact time. Discard single-use razor blades in a sharps container immediately after use.",
