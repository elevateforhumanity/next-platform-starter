        'Primary colors: red, yellow, blue. Secondary colors are made by mixing two primaries: orange (red + yellow), green (yellow + blue), violet (blue + red). Complementary colors cancel each other out — used to neutralize unwanted tones. Violet cancels yellow brassiness.\n\nHair color levels (1–10): Level 1 = black. Level 4–5 = dark brown. Level 6–7 = medium brown to dark blonde. Level 8–9 = light blonde. Level 10 = lightest blonde.\n\nTypes of hair color: Temporary — coats the cuticle, washes out in 1–2 shampoos, no developer. Semi-permanent — no developer, lasts 4–6 weeks, cannot lighten. Demi-permanent — low-volume developer, lasts 6–8 weeks, cannot lighten significantly. Permanent — opens cuticle with developer, permanent change, can lighten and deposit.',

        'Patch test procedure: Perform 24–48 hours before any chemical service. Apply a small amount of product behind the ear or inside the elbow. Leave uncovered for the required time. Inspect at 24 hours and again at 48 hours. If redness, swelling, itching, or burning occurs — do not proceed with the service.\n\nPPE for chemical services: Nitrile gloves — always, latex gloves are not adequate as chemicals can permeate. Protective apron — protects clothing and skin from splashes. Eye protection — required when mixing or applying chemicals. Ventilation — ensure adequate airflow, chemical fumes can cause respiratory irritation.\n\nContraindications — do not perform chemical services if: client has scalp abrasions, open wounds, or active skin conditions; client had a chemical service within the past 2–4 weeks; client has known allergies to ingredients; patch test showed a reaction.',

        "Relaxers break the disulfide bonds in the cortex that give hair its curl pattern. The hair is restructured in a straighter form. The neutralizer stops the process by restoring the hair's pH and re-forming bonds in the new position.\n\nRelaxer types: Lye (sodium hydroxide) — faster processing, stronger, more scalp irritation risk, requires careful timing. No-lye (guanidine) — gentler, less scalp irritation, may leave calcium deposits requiring chelating shampoo. Texturizer — same chemistry as relaxer, shorter processing time, loosens curl without fully straightening.\n\nApplication rules: Never apply to a scratched, irritated, or broken scalp. Base the scalp with petroleum jelly before application to protect skin. Apply to new growth only — do not overlap onto previously relaxed hair. Process only to the manufacturer's recommended time. Neutralize thoroughly — insufficient neutralizing causes continued processing and breakage.\n\nCritical safety rule: Never apply a relaxer to a scratched scalp. Instruct clients not to scratch their scalp for 48 hours before a relaxer service.",

        'Scalp treatment types: Moisturizing — for dry, flaky scalp, restores hydration. Clarifying — removes product buildup and excess sebum. Anti-dandruff — contains zinc pyrithione or selenium sulfide, reduces Malassezia yeast. Stimulating — increases circulation, contains menthol or peppermint.\n\nApplication procedure: Shampoo hair first to remove debris and open the scalp. Apply treatment directly to scalp in sections using an applicator bottle. Massage in with fingertip pressure — not fingernails. Process per manufacturer instructions. Rinse thoroughly — no product residue.\n\nReferral rule: Scalp treatments address cosmetic conditions. If a client has a medical scalp condition (severe seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis flare, fungal infection), refer to a physician before performing any treatment.',
