    body: `Dear Mr. Morrow,

My name is Elizabeth Greene and I serve as Executive Director of Elevate for Humanity. Our organization operates workforce training and credential programs designed to connect individuals with high-demand careers in healthcare and skilled trades.

Elevate for Humanity is currently launching a Certified Nurse Aide training pathway in partnership with an approved nurse aide training program. Our model combines online instruction with supervised hands-on clinical training at partner healthcare facilities. We are reaching out to explore a potential partnership with Greenwood Village South as a clinical training site for our students.

Through this collaboration, your facility would receive priority access to graduates who have completed structured training and are prepared to enter the workforce. Our goal is to create a reliable workforce pipeline that supports both student career development and the staffing needs of long-term care providers.

Elevate for Humanity also operates workforce credential programs and testing services affiliated with several national certification organizations, including Certiport, CareerSafe, JobReady, Milady, and ServSafe. Our broader mission is to expand access to industry-recognized credentials and employment pathways.

I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you or a member of your leadership team about hosting CNA clinical rotations and building a long-term workforce partnership.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

    body: `Hello,

My name is Elizabeth Greene and I am the Executive Director of Elevate for Humanity, a workforce development organization focused on training individuals for in-demand healthcare and technical careers.

We are launching a Certified Nurse Aide training program in partnership with an approved nurse aide training provider and are currently seeking healthcare facilities interested in serving as clinical training partners. Our students complete structured online coursework followed by supervised hands-on clinical training under RN oversight at partner facilities.

A partnership with Bloom at Eagle Creek would allow your organization to host CNA clinical rotations while gaining early access to qualified graduates entering the workforce. Our goal is to support long-term care providers by creating a consistent pipeline of trained and work-ready CNA candidates.

In addition to healthcare training pathways, Elevate for Humanity operates workforce credential programs affiliated with organizations such as Certiport, CareerSafe, JobReady, Milady, and ServSafe. We are focused on building partnerships that connect training directly to employment opportunities.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how we could collaborate to support both workforce development and your staffing needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
