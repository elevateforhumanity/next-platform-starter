        'Which chemical service permanently straightens tightly coiled hair by breaking disulfide bonds?',
      options: ['Texturizer', 'Relaxer', 'Keratin treatment', 'Temporary press'],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'A relaxer uses sodium hydroxide (lye) or guanidine (no-lye) to permanently break disulfide bonds in the cortex, straightening the hair. A texturizer uses the same chemistry but is left on for less time to loosen rather than fully straighten the curl.',

      options: [
        'To help the relaxer penetrate faster',

        'To add moisture to the hair before processing',
        'To neutralize the relaxer after processing',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Base cream (petroleum-based) is applied to the scalp, hairline, and ears before a relaxer to protect the skin from chemical burns. It does not affect the relaxer's action on the hair shaft.",

      options: [
        'Apply extra base cream and proceed',
        'Postpone the service — chemical relaxers on broken skin cause severe burns',

        'Reduce processing time by half',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Active scalp abrasions are a contraindication for all chemical services. Relaxer chemicals on broken skin cause severe chemical burns. The service must be postponed until the scalp has fully healed.',

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        'Blue is the complementary (opposite) color to orange on the color wheel. Blue-toned toners and toning shampoos neutralize brassy orange tones, which commonly appear when dark hair is lightened to a medium level.',

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Barbicide must be mixed per the manufacturer's label — typically 2 oz per 32 oz of water. Using incorrect concentrations (too dilute) renders it ineffective; too concentrated wastes product and may damage tools. Always follow label directions.",

      explanation:
        "Elasticity is the hair's ability to stretch under tension and return to its original length. Healthy hair can stretch up to 50% when wet. Poor elasticity indicates damaged cortex bonds and is a contraindication for chemical services.",

        'It controls the hair growth cycle',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'The arrector pili is a small smooth muscle attached to each hair follicle. When it contracts (triggered by cold or adrenaline), it pulls the follicle upright, causing the hair to stand and creating goosebumps. It has no role in sebum production or the growth cycle.',

      correctAnswer: 1,
