<li>Capacitor stores charge even when power is off — always discharge before handling</li>
<li>Refrigerant is heavier than air — sinks in enclosed spaces, displaces oxygen</li>
</ul>`,

  14: `<h2>Electrical Basics Quiz — Review</h2>
<p>Review Ohm's Law and electrical component operation before this quiz.</p>
<h3>Ohm's Law</h3>
<ul>
<li>V = I × R (Voltage = Current × Resistance)</li>
<li>I = V ÷ R (Current = Voltage ÷ Resistance)</li>
<li>R = V ÷ I (Resistance = Voltage ÷ Current)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacitor</strong> — stores charge to start and run motors. Measured in microfarads (µF). ±6% tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>Contactor</strong> — high-voltage relay controlled by 24V thermostat signal. Pulls in to connect line voltage to compressor and condenser fan.</li>
<li><strong>Relay</strong> — low-voltage switching device. Controls one circuit with another.</li>
<li><strong>Transformer</strong> — steps 240V down to 24V for control circuits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reading Wiring Diagrams</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ladder diagrams read left to right, top to bottom</li>
<li>Dashed lines indicate factory wiring; solid lines indicate field wiring</li>

</ol>
<h3>Pressure-Temperature Relationship</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher pressure = higher boiling point (condensing side)</li>
<li>Lower pressure = lower boiling point (evaporating side)</li>
<li>Use PT chart to convert gauge pressure to saturation temperature</li>
</ul>
<h3>Superheat and Subcooling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superheat</strong> — temperature of vapor above its saturation point at suction pressure. Indicates refrigerant charge on TXV systems.</li>
<li><strong>Subcooling</strong> — temperature of liquid below its saturation point at discharge pressure. Indicates refrigerant charge on fixed-orifice systems.</li>
</ul>`,
