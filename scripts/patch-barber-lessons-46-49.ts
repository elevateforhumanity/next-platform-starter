      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        'Indiana requires 2,000 hours of apprenticeship training under a licensed barber before a candidate is eligible to sit for the state board exam. This is one of the higher hour requirements nationally.',

        'Online exam and in-person demonstration',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'The Indiana barber exam has two parts: a written theory exam covering sanitation, anatomy, chemistry, and state laws, and a practical skills exam where candidates demonstrate haircut, shave, and sanitation procedures on a live model.',

      correctAnswer: 1,

      options: ['Sterilization', 'Disinfection', 'Sanitization', 'Decontamination'],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Disinfection reduces pathogens to a safe level on non-living surfaces using EPA-registered chemical agents. Sterilization eliminates all microorganisms (required for surgical instruments, not barbering tools). Sanitization reduces bacteria on skin or food-contact surfaces.',

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Hepatitis B is a bloodborne pathogen transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. Barbers must follow bloodborne pathogen protocols — single-use blades, proper sharps disposal, and exposure response procedures — to prevent transmission.',

      options: ['Elasticity', 'Porosity', 'Texture', 'Density'],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Porosity is the hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. High porosity = absorbs quickly, loses quickly. Low porosity = resists absorption. This is a key concept on the written exam and affects product and service selection.",

      options: ['1 year', '2 years', '3 years', '5 years'],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Indiana barber licenses are renewed on a 2-year cycle. Renewal requires completion of continuing education hours and payment of the renewal fee. Practicing with an expired license is a violation subject to fines and suspension.',

        'Their apprenticeship completion certificate',
        'Their continuing education certificates',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Indiana law requires barbers to display their current, valid barber license at their workstation where it is visible to clients. Failure to display a valid license is a violation subject to disciplinary action by the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency.',

        'On the Indiana practical exam, what is the first thing the examiner evaluates before any service begins?',

        "The candidate's consultation with the model",
        "The candidate's license display",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'The practical exam begins with a sanitation evaluation. Examiners check that tools are properly disinfected, the workstation is clean, and the client is correctly draped with a neck strip. Failing the sanitation setup can result in point deductions before any cutting begins.',
    },

      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'During the practical exam haircut, a candidate makes an uneven line. What is the best response?',
      options: [

        'Continue cutting and correct the line during the blending phase',
        'Declare the error to the examiner immediately',
        'Leave it — examiners expect some imperfection',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Minor errors during a practical exam should be corrected through the natural flow of the service — blending and finishing phases exist precisely to refine the cut. Stopping to ask for help or declaring errors draws unnecessary attention. Examiners evaluate the final result and technique, not individual strokes.',

        'Pack up tools and exit quickly',
        'Ask the examiner for feedback on the haircut',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Post-service sanitation is part of the practical exam score. Candidates must clean and disinfect tools, properly dispose of single-use items, remove draping, and sanitize the workstation. This demonstrates professional standards and is evaluated by the examiner.',
