      id: 'm2-l11-q6',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'A client presents with circular patches of hair loss with smooth, non-inflamed skin. Which condition does this most likely indicate?',
      options: [
        'Tinea capitis',
        'Alopecia areata',
        'Androgenetic alopecia',
        'Seborrheic dermatitis',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Alopecia areata presents as well-defined circular patches of hair loss with smooth, non-scarred skin. It is an autoimmune condition. The barber must refer the client to a physician — no barbering service should be performed on affected areas.',
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l11-q7',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question: 'Tinea capitis is caused by:',
      options: [
        'A bacterial infection',
        'A fungal infection',
        'An autoimmune response',
        'Excessive sebum production',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) is a fungal infection. It is highly contagious. A barber must refuse service and refer the client to a physician. All tools that contacted the client must be disinfected immediately.',
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l11-q8',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'When should a barber refuse to perform a service on a client with a scalp condition?',
      options: [
        'Only if the client requests it',
        'Whenever the condition appears contagious, involves open sores, or is of unknown origin',
        'Only for conditions that affect the hair shaft',
        'Never — the barber should always attempt to serve the client',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'State board rules require barbers to refuse service when a condition appears contagious (fungal, bacterial, parasitic), involves open lesions, or is undiagnosed. This protects both the client and subsequent clients from cross-contamination.',
    },

  'barber-lesson-12': [
    {
      id: 'm2-l12-q6',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        "A client's face shape is wider at the forehead and narrows to a pointed chin. Which face shape is this?",
      options: ['Round', 'Square', 'Heart', 'Oblong'],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        'A heart-shaped face is widest at the forehead and temples, narrowing to a pointed chin. Haircut recommendations typically add width at the jaw and reduce volume at the top to create balance.',
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l12-q7',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'During a consultation, the client says they want to "keep the length." What should the barber do?',
      options: [
        'Take no length off at all',
        'Clarify what "keep the length" means to the client — confirm in inches and show reference photos',
        'Trim only the ends',
        'Proceed with a standard trim and adjust if the client objects',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        '"Keep the length" is subjective. A professional barber always clarifies with specific measurements and visual references before cutting. Assumptions lead to dissatisfied clients and lost business.',
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l12-q8',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'Which of the following is NOT a contraindication that should be identified during a client consultation?',
      options: [
        'Active scalp infection',
        'Blood-thinning medication',
        "The client's preferred music genre",
        'Known allergy to chemical products',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        'Contraindications are health or safety factors that affect service decisions. Active infections, medications affecting bleeding, and chemical allergies are all clinically relevant. Music preference is a comfort preference, not a contraindication.',
    },

  'barber-lesson-13': [
    {
      id: 'm2-l13-q6',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question: 'What water temperature should be used when shampooing a client?',
      options: [
        'Cold — to close the cuticle',
        'Hot — to open the cuticle and remove buildup',
        "Comfortably warm — tested on the barber's wrist before applying to the client",
        'Temperature does not matter',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Water should be comfortably warm — always tested on the barber's inner wrist before applying to the client's scalp. Hot water can cause burns; cold water is uncomfortable and less effective at removing product buildup.",
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l13-q7',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question:
        'During a scalp massage, which movement uses the fingertips in a circular motion to stimulate circulation?',
      options: ['Effleurage', 'Petrissage', 'Tapotement', 'Friction'],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        'Friction uses the fingertips in firm circular movements directly on the scalp to stimulate blood circulation and loosen debris. Effleurage is light stroking; petrissage is kneading; tapotement is tapping.',
    },
    {
      id: 'm2-l13-q8',
      type: 'multiple_choice',
      question: 'Which shampoo type is most appropriate for a client with an oily scalp?',
      options: [
        'Moisturizing shampoo',
        'Clarifying or balancing shampoo formulated to reduce excess sebum',
        'Color-safe shampoo',
        'Baby shampoo',
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'Clarifying or balancing shampoos are formulated to remove excess oil and product buildup without stripping the scalp entirely. Moisturizing shampoos would add unnecessary hydration to an already oily scalp.',
    },
