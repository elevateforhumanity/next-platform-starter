const content = `<h2>Straight Razor Shave Procedure</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Execute a complete professional straight razor shave — from pre-service assessment through post-service care — using correct blade angle, skin tension, grain mapping, and stroke mechanics. Identify contraindications before touching the client and apply corrective logic when the shave deviates from plan.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grain mapping</strong> — charting the direction of hair growth across each facial zone before the first pass</li>
  <li><strong>Blade angle</strong> — the angle between the razor spine and the skin surface; 30° is the working standard</li>
  <li><strong>Skin tension</strong> — manual stretching of the skin to create a flat cutting surface; prevents nicks and drag</li>
  <li><strong>Lather consistency</strong> — the correct water-to-product ratio that lubricates without collapsing under blade pressure</li>
  <li><strong>Three-pass protocol</strong> — WTG (with grain), XTG (across grain), ATG (against grain); each pass has a specific purpose and client indication</li>
  <li><strong>Contraindications</strong> — conditions that require service refusal or modification before any blade contacts skin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre-Service: Assessment and Setup</h3>

<h4>Step 1 — Contraindication Check</h4>
<p>Before draping the client, visually inspect the shave area under good lighting. You are looking for:</p>

<h4>Step 2 — Grain Mapping</h4>
<p>Run a clean fingertip across the beard in multiple directions to feel resistance. Hair growth direction varies by zone — do not assume it is uniform. Map each zone before lathering:</p>

<h4>Step 3 — Hot Towel Application</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Heat towel to 110–120°F (test on inner wrist — warm but not painful)</li>
  <li>Wring thoroughly — excess water dilutes lather and cools the towel faster</li>
  <li>Apply to face, molding to contours of cheeks, chin, and neck</li>
  <li>Leave on 2–3 minutes — softens the hair shaft, swells the cuticle, opens follicles</li>
  <li>Remove and immediately apply pre-shave oil while skin is still warm and pores are open</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Softened hair requires 65% less cutting force. Skipping or rushing the hot towel is the single most common cause of razor drag and post-shave irritation.</p>

<h4>Step 4 — Lather Preparation</h4>
<p>Lather is not just lubrication — it is a barrier between the blade and the skin. Incorrect consistency is a direct cause of nicks and irritation.</p>

</table>
<p>Apply lather with a brush using circular motions to lift the hair away from the skin and coat each strand from base to tip. Work against the grain during application — this lifts the hair for a cleaner first pass.</p>

<h3>Service Execution: The Three-Pass Protocol</h3>

<h4>Blade Angle and Skin Tension — Non-Negotiable Mechanics</h4>
<p><strong>Blade angle:</strong> Hold the razor so the spine is approximately 30° from the skin surface. At this angle, the edge contacts the hair without the spine dragging. Steeper than 30° increases nick risk. Flatter than 20° causes the blade to skate without cutting.</p>
<p><strong>Skin tension:</strong> Use the non-dominant hand to stretch the skin taut in the opposite direction of the stroke. A flat cutting surface prevents the blade from catching skin folds. Insufficient tension is the primary cause of nicks on the neck and jawline.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke mechanics:</strong> Short, controlled strokes of 1–2 inches. Rinse the blade after every 2–3 strokes. A blade loaded with cut hair and lather loses its glide and increases drag pressure.</p>

<h4>Pass 1 — With the Grain (WTG)</h4>
<p>Cut in the direction of hair growth. This is the safest pass and removes 70–80% of the beard length. Every client receives this pass. Work systematically: right cheek → left cheek → upper lip → chin → neck. Never skip zones or return to a zone mid-pass — this disrupts lather coverage and increases irritation.</p>

<h4>Pass 2 — Across the Grain (XTG)</h4>
<p>Cut perpendicular to hair growth. Removes the remaining stubble that WTG left behind. Apply a fresh, thin layer of lather before this pass. Decision logic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If client has razor bumps → stop here, do not proceed to ATG</li>
  <li>If client has sensitive skin → stop here unless they explicitly request ATG and understand the risk</li>
  <li>If client has normal skin and wants a close shave → proceed to Pass 3</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pass 3 — Against the Grain (ATG)</h4>
<p>Cut opposite to hair growth direction. Produces the closest possible result. Carries the highest risk of irritation, ingrown hairs, and micro-abrasion. Apply a third layer of lather. Use lighter pressure than Passes 1 and 2 — the hair is now very short and the blade is working against follicle direction. The neck zone requires the most care here — grain direction is often inconsistent and skin is thinner.</p>

<h3>Post-Service Protocol</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cold towel</strong> — apply immediately after the final pass. Closes follicles, reduces redness, stops minor bleeding from micro-abrasions.</li>
  <li><strong>Styptic application</strong> — if a nick occurred, apply styptic pencil or powder directly to the wound. Do not wipe — press and hold 10–15 seconds. Inform the client.</li>
  <li><strong>Aftershave balm or toner</strong> — apply based on skin type. Alcohol-based toners for oily skin; balm for dry or sensitive skin. Never apply alcohol-based product to broken skin.</li>
  <li><strong>Moisturizer</strong> — seal the skin barrier. Shaving removes the top layer of dead skin cells along with the hair.</li>
  <li><strong>Tool sanitation</strong> — disinfect the razor immediately. Fixed blade: strop and store. Shavette: remove and dispose of blade in a sharps container.</li>
</ol>

      'Refuse the straight razor service and explain the contraindication to the client',
      'Apply extra lather over the pustules and proceed carefully',
      'Use a safety razor instead of a straight razor for this client',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Active pustules are a contraindication for straight razor service. The blade will rupture them, spread bacteria across the face, and create open wounds. Refusing the service is the only correct action — a safety razor does not change this.',
  },

    id: 'mod5-l30-q2',
    question:
      'During a shave, the razor is dragging and pulling instead of gliding. The blade was just rinsed. What is the most likely cause?',
    options: [
      'The blade angle is too steep',
      'The client has coarse hair',
      'The lather consistency is too dry — insufficient water content',
      'The hot towel was applied too long',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Drag after rinsing the blade points to lather consistency. Dry lather has insufficient slip — it creates friction between the blade and skin. Add water a few drops at a time and re-work the brush before continuing.',
  },
  {
    id: 'mod5-l30-q3',
    question:
      'What is the primary mechanical purpose of applying skin tension during a straight razor shave?',
    options: [
      'To increase blood flow to the shave area',
      'To create a flat cutting surface that prevents the blade from catching skin folds',
      'To open the hair follicles before the blade passes',
      'To reduce the amount of lather needed per pass',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Skin tension flattens the cutting surface. Without it, skin folds and contours catch the blade edge, causing nicks — especially on the neck and jawline where the skin is loose and the grain direction is inconsistent.',
  },

    id: 'mod5-l30-q4',
    question:
      'A client with pseudofolliculitis barbae (razor bumps) requests a full three-pass shave. What is the correct response?',
    options: [
      'Complete all three passes as requested — client preference overrides technique',
      'Perform WTG and XTG passes only; explain that ATG worsens the ingrown hair cycle for this condition',
      'Refuse the shave service entirely',
      'Perform the ATG pass only on the cheeks and skip the neck',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Pseudofolliculitis barbae is caused by hairs curling back into the skin after cutting. ATG cuts hair below the follicle opening, increasing re-entry likelihood. WTG and XTG passes reduce this risk while still providing a close result.',

      'Apply cold towel first, then alcohol-based aftershave to disinfect',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Styptic is applied first and directly — it constricts the blood vessel and stops bleeding. Wiping removes the clotting agent. Alcohol on broken skin causes pain and further irritation. The client must be informed of any nick.',

    options: [
      'The neck has the thickest skin on the face',
      'Neck hair always grows in a single consistent direction',
      'The neck has thinner skin and frequently inconsistent grain direction, increasing nick and ingrown hair risk',
      'The ATG pass is not recommended for any zone below the jawline',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'The neck combines two high-risk factors: thinner skin more vulnerable to micro-abrasion, and inconsistent grain direction that makes a single stroke direction unreliable. Grain mapping the neck before the ATG pass is essential.',
  },

    id: 'mod5-l30-q7',
    question:
      'Why is lather applied against the grain during the brush application phase, before the first razor pass?',
    options: [
      'To pre-cut the hair before the razor contacts it',
      'To lift the hair away from the skin so the razor can cut closer to the base',
      'To reduce the amount of product needed for the second pass',
      'To close the follicles before the blade opens them',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Applying lather against the grain lifts each hair strand away from the skin surface, standing it upright. This allows the razor to cut closer to the base on the first pass, reducing the number of passes needed and minimizing skin contact time.',
