    title: 'Residential Condenser Unit — Identify the Components',

      intro:
        'The condenser unit is the outdoor half of a split air conditioning system. It contains the components responsible for compressing refrigerant, rejecting heat to the outdoor air, and controlling electrical power to the system. Study these five components before you interact with the 3D model.',

          id: 'compressor',
          name: 'Compressor',
          location: 'Inside the lower section of the condenser cabinet',
          function:
            'Pumps refrigerant through the entire system. It receives low-pressure, low-temperature gas from the evaporator (indoor coil) and compresses it into high-pressure, high-temperature gas that flows to the condenser coil.',
          whyItMatters:
            'The compressor is the most expensive component in the system. A failed compressor usually means a full system replacement on older units.',
          fieldTip:
            'Always check amperage draw against the nameplate rating. High amps with low cooling output often indicates a failing compressor.',

          id: 'fan-motor',
          name: 'Fan Motor',
          location: 'Top of the condenser unit, behind the protective grille',
          function:
            'Pulls outdoor air across the condenser coil so the refrigerant inside can release heat and change from a high-pressure gas back to a high-pressure liquid. The fan is driven by a dedicated motor mounted to the fan shroud.',
          whyItMatters:
            'If the condenser fan fails, the unit cannot reject heat. High-side pressure will spike, the compressor will overheat, and the system will shut down on a safety limit.',
          fieldTip:
            'Spin the fan blade by hand with the power off. If it does not spin freely, the motor bearings are failing. Check the fan capacitor before replacing the motor.',
