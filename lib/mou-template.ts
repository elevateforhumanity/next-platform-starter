PROGRAM HOLDER / TRAINING PROVIDER
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)

This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") outlines the collaborative partnership between:

${PLATFORM_DEFAULTS.orgName} Career & Technical Institute
("Elevate", "EFH", or "Training Sponsor")

and

${data.programHolderName}
("Program Holder" or "Training Provider")

together referred to as the "Parties."

NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP:

This MOU establishes a collaborative partnership where both parties work together to deliver high-quality workforce training. This is NOT an employer-employee relationship, franchise, or subordinate arrangement. Instead, this is a partnership of equals working toward shared goals:

• Elevate provides the infrastructure, compliance framework, funding coordination, and wraparound services
• Program Holder provides the hands-on training, facility, instruction, and day-to-day student support
• Both parties collaborate to ensure student success and program quality
• Both parties share in the revenue generated from successful student outcomes

This collaborative model allows Program Holders to focus on what they do best (training) while Elevate handles the administrative complexity of workforce development programs.

1. PURPOSE OF THIS MOU

The purpose of this MOU is to establish a clear, written understanding of how Elevate and the Program Holder will work together to deliver workforce training programs (for example: WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL-registered apprenticeships, and other aligned initiatives) and how revenue will be shared for eligible, funded participants who complete training and/or earn credentials.

2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1 ${PLATFORM_DEFAULTS.orgName} will:

a. Serve as the primary training sponsor and system of record for the programs listed in this MOU.

b. Provide and maintain the Elevate Learning Management System (LMS), participant portal, case notes, certificates, and reporting tools.

c. Coordinate with state and local workforce agencies, credentialing partners, and funding sources to keep programs compliant and in good standing.

d. Enroll participants into approved training tracks and track participation, training hours, completions, and certifications.

e. Manage collection of funds from workforce programs and other funders.

f. Calculate and issue revenue share payments to Program Holder according to the compensation structure described in Section 4.

2.2 Program Holder will:

a. Provide a safe, professional training environment for participants, including physical space and day-to-day supervision at the worksite or classroom.

b. Deliver hands-on training, coaching, and supervision consistent with the curriculum, scope of work, and compliance requirements provided by Elevate and/or credentialing partners.

c. Maintain reasonable attendance expectations, sign-in procedures, and communication with participants.

d. Enter case notes, progress updates, and follow-up information into the Elevate portal as requested.

e. Notify Elevate promptly of any issues that may impact a participant's participation, safety, or eligibility.

f. Comply with all applicable laws, policies, and regulations relating to workplace safety, nondiscrimination, confidentiality, and workforce programs.

3. PROGRAMS COVERED

This MOU may cover one or more training tracks, including but not limited to:

• Barber / Beauty Apprenticeship
• CNA / Patient Care / Home Health
• HVAC / Building Technician / Construction
• Peer Support / Recovery Coach
• Financial Literacy / Tax Training
• Other industry-recognized credential programs

Specific programs, credentials, and funding streams (WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL, etc.) may be added or updated in writing (email or signed addendum) without rewriting the entire MOU.

4. COMPENSATION AND REVENUE SHARE

4.1 Definition of Net Program Revenue

For each funded participant, Elevate may receive program revenue from one or more sources (for example: WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL, employer contributions, or tuition). For the purpose of this agreement, Net Program Revenue means:

Total eligible training revenue actually received by Elevate for that participant
MINUS direct, required program costs including:
• Credentialing partner fees (testing, licensing, third-party exam vendors)
• Required background checks, drug screens, or clearances
• Approved learner toolkits and required equipment (kits, books, scrubs, PPE, basic tools)
• Platform, processing, and compliance fees directly tied to that participant or that training program

Net Program Revenue is calculated at the participant/program level or in reasonable grouped batches, using documentation maintained by Elevate.

4.2 Program Holder Share (Universal 1/3 Model - PER STUDENT)

For EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT who is officially enrolled, funded, and started training under this MOU, the Program Holder will receive:

ONE-THIRD (1/3 or 33.33%) of the Net Program Revenue associated with THAT SPECIFIC STUDENT's training track.

IMPORTANT: This is calculated and paid PER STUDENT, not as a lump sum. Each student generates their own separate payment to the Program Holder.

This universal rate applies to all Program Holders and all programs to ensure fairness and consistency across the network.

PAYMENT STRUCTURE - TWO INCREMENTS PER STUDENT:

Payment 1 (50% of Program Holder Share PER STUDENT):
• Paid at mid-enrollment milestone FOR EACH STUDENT
• When that specific student reaches 50% completion of training hours
• After enrollment verified and mid-point progress documented
• Approximately 16.67% of Net Program Revenue FOR THAT STUDENT

Payment 2 (50% of Program Holder Share PER STUDENT):
• Paid upon successful completion FOR EACH STUDENT
• When that specific student completes training and earns credential
• After completion verified and credential issued
• Approximately 16.67% of Net Program Revenue FOR THAT STUDENT

Total Program Holder Share PER STUDENT: 33.33% of Net Program Revenue (1/3)
Elevate Retains PER STUDENT: 66.67% of Net Program Revenue (2/3)

EXAMPLE: If you have 10 students enrolled:
• You receive payments for each of the 10 students individually
• Each student's funding generates separate Payment 1 and Payment 2
• More students = more total revenue for Program Holder

Elevate retains the remaining Net Program Revenue to cover administrative, platform, staffing, compliance, coordination costs, and to support wraparound services for participants including:
• Case management and support services
• Career counseling and job placement
• Transportation and childcare assistance
• Emergency financial assistance
• Mental health and substance abuse support
• Technology and equipment loans
• Tutoring and academic support

4.3 Timing of Payments

a. Payments to Program Holder will generally be issued on a monthly cycle, once funds have been received and reconciled by Elevate.

b. Mid-enrollment payments (Payment 1) will be processed within 30 days of participant reaching 50% completion milestone.

c. Completion payments (Payment 2) will be processed within 30 days of credential issuance and final verification.

d. A summary statement will be provided showing:
   • Number of participants
   • Funding source(s)
   • Gross revenue, direct program expenses, and Net Program Revenue
   • Amount payable to Program Holder (1/3 share split into two payments)
   • Payment 1 status (mid-enrollment)
   • Payment 2 status (completion)

4.4 Non-Funded / Free Participants

Some participants may be served under free, pilot, scholarship, or fully internally funded initiatives. Elevate may elect to include or exclude those participants from the revenue share. Any such exceptions will be clarified in writing (email or addendum) for transparency.

5. DATA, REPORTING, AND CASE NOTES

a. Elevate will provide Program Holder with secure access to the delegate portal to enter case notes, statuses (On Track, At Risk, Not Engaged), and follow-up dates for participants they host.

b. Program Holder agrees to record reasonable case notes and updates to support compliance with workforce program documentation and audits.

c. Elevate will maintain training records, certificates, and participation reports and may share aggregated or participant-level reports with agencies, funders, and employers as required by program rules and privacy laws.
