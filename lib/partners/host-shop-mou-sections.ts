The Shop is responsible for payroll, withholding, workers' compensation, and all employer obligations under Indiana and federal law.

WAGES: Pay the apprentice according to the agreed progressive wage schedule (see Section 5). Failure to pay the apprentice as agreed is grounds for immediate termination of this MOU and will be reported to USDOL.

• Represent to any funding agency, employer, or student that the Shop independently operates the Indiana Barber Host Shop Program
