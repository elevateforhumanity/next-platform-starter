 *
 * To create the testing-specific event type:
 *   1. Go to https://calendly.com/elevate4humanityedu
 *   2. Create a new event type: "Testing Center Appointment" — 60 min, in-person
 *   3. Set the slug to "testing" → URL becomes calendly.com/elevate4humanityedu/testing
 *   4. Update CALENDLY_TESTING_URL below
 *
 * Until the dedicated event type is created, CALENDLY_TESTING_URL falls back
 * to the general scheduling page.
