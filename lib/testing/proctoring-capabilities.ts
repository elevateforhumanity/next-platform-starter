 *
 * Three capability types:
 *   IN_PERSON_ONLY            — exam must be taken at a physical testing site
 *   IN_PERSON_OR_PROVIDER_REMOTE — provider runs their own remote system; center can also host in-person
 *   CENTER_REMOTE_ALLOWED     — Elevate can proctor live online (center-controlled remote)
 *
 * This drives what booking options appear in the UI and prevents compliance errors
 * (e.g. offering remote proctoring for an exam that requires in-person supervision).
