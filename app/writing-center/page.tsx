      question: "How do I submit a draft for review?",
      answer: "Log in to the LMS, navigate to Help > Writing Center, and upload your document (Word, Google Docs link, or PDF). Include the assignment prompt and any specific questions you have. A writing tutor will review your draft and return detailed feedback within 48 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I meet with a tutor in real time?",
      answer: "Yes. Book a 30-minute live session through the LMS tutoring portal. Sessions are available via Zoom or in-person at the Indianapolis training center. Live sessions are ideal for brainstorming, outlining, or working through revisions together."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Writing Center only for English classes?",
      answer: "No. The Writing Center helps with any writing task — course assignments, resumes, cover letters, business plans, professional emails, scholarship essays, and even social media content for entrepreneurship students. If it involves writing, we can help."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the tutor write my paper for me?",
      answer: "No. Tutors provide feedback, suggestions, and guidance — but the writing is yours. We'll help you improve your structure, fix grammar issues, strengthen your arguments, and meet assignment requirements. The goal is to make you a better writer, not to do the work for you."
    },
    {
      question: "How many times can I use the Writing Center?",
      answer: "Enrolled students can submit up to 3 drafts per week for written review and book up to 2 live sessions per week. There's no limit on the total number of visits during your enrollment. We encourage students to use the Writing Center early and often."
    },
    {
      question: "I struggle with basic writing. Is that okay?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Many of our students are returning to education after years away. Writing tutors are trained to meet you where you are — whether that's basic sentence structure or polishing a graduate-level essay. No judgment, just support."
