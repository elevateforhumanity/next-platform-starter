              The Elevate HVAC Technician Training Program is a {TOTAL_HOURS}-hour
              competency-based workforce development program that prepares
              students for entry-level HVAC technician positions. The program
              combines {TOTAL_THEORY} hours of online theory instruction with{" "}
              {TOTAL_OJT} hours of supervised on-the-job training (OJT) at
              employer partner sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students demonstrate mastery across {TOTAL_COMPETENCIES} competencies
              organized into 7 domains. Theory competencies are assessed through
              quizzes and cumulative exams with a minimum 80% passing score.
              Performance competencies ({OJT_COMPETENCIES} total) require
              hands-on verification by a qualified OJT supervisor using
              standardized skill checksheets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon successful completion, students earn six industry-recognized
              credentials: EPA 608 Universal Certification, OSHA 30-Hour
              Construction Safety, CPR/First Aid/AED, NRF Rise Up Customer
              Service, and Elevate Residential HVAC Certification Levels 1
              and 2.

              <strong>Attendance:</strong> Students must complete all 95 lessons
              and accumulate the required OJT hours. Consecutive absence of 14+
              days without communication results in administrative withdrawal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> All assessments must be
              completed independently. Sharing quiz answers or misrepresenting
              OJT performance results in disciplinary action up to program
              dismissal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Grading:</strong> Theory assessments require 80% minimum.
              Performance assessments are Pass/Remediate. Students who do not
              pass a performance competency receive additional supervised
              practice and re-assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ADA Compliance:</strong> All video content includes closed
              captions. Accommodations for documented disabilities are provided
              upon request through the student&apos;s case manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Grievance Procedure:</strong> Students may submit
              grievances through the LMS support portal or directly to program
              administration. All grievances receive written response within 5
              business days.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Instructor Qualifications:</strong> All OJT supervisors
              hold a minimum of EPA 608 Universal Certification and 3+ years of
              field experience. Theory content is developed and reviewed by
              licensed HVAC professionals.
