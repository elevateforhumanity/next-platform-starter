      question: 'Who qualifies for free VITA tax help?',
      answer:
        'Generally, individuals and families earning $64,000 or less per year qualify. Persons with disabilities and limited English-speaking taxpayers also qualify regardless of income.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost?',
      answer:
        'VITA services are Funded. There are no fees, no hidden charges, and no upsells. Everything from tax preparation to e-filing is provided at no cost.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need an appointment?',
      answer:
        'Yes, appointments are required. Call support center to schedule. Walk-ins may experience very long wait times or may not be seen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What documents do I need to bring?',
      answer:
        "You'll need photo ID, Social Security cards for everyone on the return, all W-2s and 1099s, bank account information for direct deposit, and last year's tax return if available.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take?',
      answer:
        'Most appointments take 45-90 minutes depending on the complexity of your return. Simple returns may be faster, while returns with multiple income sources or deductions may take longer.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help with business taxes?',
      answer:
        'VITA focuses on individual tax returns. We can handle simple self-employment income (Schedule C), but complex business returns should be prepared by a paid professional.',
    },
    {
      question: 'When will I get my refund?',
      answer:
        'If you choose direct deposit, most refunds arrive within 21 days of e-filing. Paper checks take 4-6 weeks. The IRS provides a refund tracker at IRS.gov/refunds.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a refund advance?',
      answer:
        'No, VITA does not offer refund advances. If you need immediate cash, consider our paid service SupersonicFastCash which offers refund advances up to $7,500.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I owe taxes?',
      answer:
        "We can still prepare your return for free. We'll help you understand your payment options and set up a payment plan with the IRS if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you amend a previous year's return?",
      answer:
        'Yes, we can help with amended returns (Form 1040-X) for the current and prior three years, subject to volunteer availability.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you prepare state returns?',
      answer:
        'Yes, we prepare both federal and Indiana state returns at no charge.',
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm missing a W-2 or 1099?",
      answer:
        "Contact your employer or payer first. If you can't get it, the IRS can provide a wage and income transcript. Contact us for guidance.",
