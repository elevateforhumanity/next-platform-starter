              &quot;Confidential Information&quot; means any information disclosed by Elevate to the Receiving Party
              that is not publicly available, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Curriculum and instructional content</strong> — all lesson plans, assessments, competency frameworks, LMS content, and training materials</li>
              <li><strong>Operational procedures</strong> — enrollment processes, compliance workflows, reporting systems, and internal policies</li>
              <li><strong>Student data</strong> — all personally identifiable information (PII) about students, including names, contact information, enrollment status, attendance, and outcomes (also protected separately under FERPA)</li>
              <li><strong>Financial information</strong> — tuition structures, revenue-sharing formulas, payment schedules, cost breakdowns, and funding arrangements</li>
              <li><strong>Technology systems</strong> — LMS architecture, platform integrations, software configurations, and API relationships</li>
              <li><strong>Business relationships</strong> — employer partners, credential bodies, funding agency contacts, and referral networks</li>
              <li><strong>Strategic plans</strong> — expansion plans, new program development, grant strategies, and partnership pipeline</li>
              <li><strong>Brand and identity</strong> — unpublished marketing materials, brand guidelines, and communications strategies</li>

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
              <strong>Plain language:</strong> If Elevate gave it to you to do your job as a partner, it is
              confidential. This includes things you learned by being inside the operation — not just
              documents handed to you.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-3">The Receiving Party agrees to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Keep it confidential.</strong> Do not disclose Confidential Information to any person or organization that is not authorized by Elevate in writing.</li>
              <li><strong>Use it only for authorized purposes.</strong> Confidential Information may only be used to fulfill your obligations under your Elevate agreement. It may not be used to develop competing programs, apply for independent funding, or benefit any other organization.</li>
              <li><strong>Protect it.</strong> Apply at least the same level of care to Elevate&apos;s Confidential Information as you apply to your own confidential information — and no less than reasonable care.</li>
              <li><strong>Limit internal access.</strong> Only share Confidential Information with your own staff or contractors who need it to fulfill your Elevate obligations, and only after informing them of these confidentiality requirements.</li>
              <li><strong>Return or destroy it upon request.</strong> When your agreement ends or upon Elevate&apos;s written request, return all Confidential Information (including copies) or certify in writing that it has been destroyed.</li>

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
              <strong>Plain language:</strong> Do not share it. Do not use it for anything other than your
              Elevate work. When the relationship ends, give it back or delete it.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-3">
              This Agreement does not apply to information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Was already publicly available at the time of disclosure through no breach of this Agreement</li>
              <li>Was already in the Receiving Party&apos;s possession before Elevate disclosed it, with no confidentiality obligation attached</li>
              <li>Was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of any Elevate Confidential Information</li>
              <li>Is required to be disclosed by law, court order, or government agency — in which case the Receiving Party must notify Elevate in writing as soon as possible before making the disclosure</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mt-3">
              <strong>Plain language:</strong> If it was already public, you already knew it independently,
              or a court orders you to disclose it, this Agreement does not apply. But you cannot use these
              exceptions as a loophole — the burden of proof is on you.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-3">
              Student personally identifiable information (PII) is subject to additional protections under
              FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g. In addition to the

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li>You may not disclose student PII to any third party without written student consent and Elevate authorization.</li>
              <li>You may not use student data for any purpose other than fulfilling your obligations under your Elevate agreement.</li>
              <li>You must report any unauthorized disclosure of student data to Elevate within 24 hours of discovery.</li>
              <li>FERPA violations carry federal penalties independent of this Agreement.</li>

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-3">
              Confidentiality obligations under this Agreement begin on the date you first receive
              Confidential Information from Elevate and continue for:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Three (3) years</strong> after the termination or expiration of your Elevate agreement for general Confidential Information.</li>
              <li><strong>Indefinitely</strong> for student PII, which remains protected under FERPA regardless of when the relationship ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mt-3">
              <strong>Plain language:</strong> When your agreement with Elevate ends, you still cannot
              disclose or use Elevate&apos;s confidential information for 3 years. Student data is protected
              forever.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-3">
              The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable
              harm to Elevate for which monetary damages alone would be inadequate. In the event of a
              breach or threatened breach, Elevate is entitled to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Immediate injunctive relief</strong> — a court order stopping the disclosure or use of Confidential Information, without the requirement to post a bond</li>
              <li><strong>Monetary damages</strong> — compensation for actual losses caused by the breach</li>
              <li><strong>Recovery of attorney&apos;s fees and costs</strong> incurred in enforcing this Agreement</li>
              <li><strong>Immediate termination</strong> of your Elevate agreement without the standard notice period</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mt-3">
              <strong>Plain language:</strong> If you disclose Elevate&apos;s confidential information without
              authorization, Elevate can go to court immediately to stop you and sue you for damages.
              This is not a threat — it is a statement of legal rights.
