  {
    question: 'How do I find out if I qualify for WIOA funding?',
    answer:
      'Contact your local WorkOne office or visit workone.in.gov. A career advisor will assess your eligibility based on income, employment status, and other factors. Elevate for Humanity does not determine WIOA eligibility — that is the responsibility of your local workforce agency.',
