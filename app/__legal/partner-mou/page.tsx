          <p>
            For the purposes of clarity and legal precision, a <strong>"partnership"</strong> is defined
            as a business relationship in which two or more parties jointly own and operate a business
            enterprise, share governance authority, share profits and losses, and maintain equal or
            negotiated control over business operations, including pricing, staffing, branding, and
            strategic direction.

            Elevate retains sole authority to expand the training program into additional states and

            collaborators.
