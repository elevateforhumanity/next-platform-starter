              This page explains what your experience looks like as a student at Elevate — from
              the day you enroll to the day you start your new job. No jargon, no acronyms without

              Elevate operates as a Hybrid Workforce Training Provider and Registered
              Apprenticeship Sponsor. Related Technical Instruction (RTI) is delivered through
              licensed credential partners and authorized program holders under centralized
              curriculum oversight. On-the-Job Training (OJT) is conducted by approved employer
              partners. Elevate manages enrollment, funding navigation, progress tracking,
              competency assessment, and career services.

              Every program combines some form of classroom instruction, hands-on practice, and
              online coursework. The mix depends on your program. A CDL student spends most of
              their time behind the wheel of a truck. A CNA student splits time between a classroom
              and a clinical rotation at a healthcare facility. A cybersecurity student works
              primarily online with live virtual instructor sessions.

                    You come to a training facility 3–5 days per week. Mornings are typically classroom
                    instruction — theory, code requirements, safety protocols, exam prep. Afternoons are
                    hands-on: you work with real tools and equipment in a lab or shop environment.
                    Healthcare students do clinical rotations at actual healthcare facilities where they
                    work with real patients under supervision.
