              Elevate runs custom training cohorts for workforce boards, community organizations,
              employers, and government agencies. This page explains exactly how it works — what

              like Goodwill or a community organization, an HR director at a company that needs trained workers, or
              a grant administrator evaluating training providers — this page is for you.
