              Programs follow a five-stage pathway: eligibility screening, cohort-based training, industry
              credentialing, apprenticeship or job placement, and ongoing advancement support. Whether you are training to become a CNA, a
              CDL driver, a licensed barber, an HVAC technician, or a cybersecurity analyst — the
              pathway structure is the same.

              partners and approved program holders under centralized institutional oversight,

            <p>
              In all cases, credentials are issued by recognized third-party authorities (Indiana
              ISDH, Indiana BMV, EPA, OSHA, Certiport, AWS, NCCER, Indiana PLA) — not by Elevate.
              Elevate prepares participants for certification exams. The credential itself comes
              from the issuing authority.

              Apprenticeship programs (Barber, Building Technician) are DOL Registered
