          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b-2 border-brand-blue-600 pb-2 mt-0">Part 1: Your Rights as a Program Holder</h2>
          <p>
            These rights exist to protect you. Elevate is obligated to honor them. If you believe any of
            these rights have been violated, you have the right to file a formal grievance (see Section R5).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R1. Right to Timely Payment</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to receive payment for services rendered according to the tier structure in
            your MOU. Payments will be processed within 30 days of receiving a complete, properly documented
            invoice. Elevate may not withhold payment without written explanation and an opportunity for you
            to cure any documentation deficiency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
            <strong>What this means plainly:</strong> If you did the work, submitted the attendance records,
            and invoiced correctly, you get paid. Elevate cannot simply not pay you.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R2. Right to Clear Communication</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to receive clear, written communication about any policy changes, compliance
            requirements, or decisions that affect your program. Elevate will not change material terms of
            your agreement without written notice. You have the right to ask questions and receive answers
            in writing.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R3. Right to Resources and Support</h3>
          <p>You have the right to access:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Elevate LMS platform and all tools included in your tier</li>
            <li>Marketing materials and recruitment support</li>
            <li>Compliance guidance and WIOA training</li>
            <li>Student support services coordination</li>
            <li>Your assigned Elevate coordinator for regular check-ins</li>
            <li>Elevate&apos;s credential exam relationships and testing resources</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R4. Right to Due Process Before Termination</h3>
          <p>
            Except for immediate termination triggers (see Section T3 below), Elevate will not terminate
            your agreement without first issuing a written corrective action notice and giving you 15 days
            to cure the issue. If the issue is not resolved, Elevate will issue a 30-day written termination
            notice before the agreement ends.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
            <strong>What this means plainly:</strong> Elevate cannot simply cut you off without warning for
            ordinary compliance issues. You get notice, you get a chance to fix it, and you get 30 days.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R5. Right to File a Grievance</h3>
          <p>
            If you believe Elevate has violated your rights under this agreement, you may file a formal
            written grievance to <strong>elevate4humanityedu@gmail.com</strong> with the subject line
            &quot;Program Holder Grievance.&quot; Elevate will respond in writing within 10 business days.
            Filing a grievance does not affect your standing as a Program Holder and will not result in
            retaliation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R6. Right to Exit with 30 Days Notice</h3>

                Send written notice (email is acceptable) to your assigned Elevate coordinator and copy

                intended termination date (minimum 30 days from the date of notice). You do not need to
                provide a reason. You do not need Elevate&apos;s permission.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">R7. Right to Confidentiality of Your Business Information</h3>
          <p>
            Elevate will not disclose your organization&apos;s proprietary business information, financial
            records, or internal operations to third parties without your written consent, except as required
            by law or federal oversight agencies.

          <p>
            These responsibilities are not suggestions. They are conditions of your authorization to operate
            as a Program Holder. Failure to meet them may result in corrective action, suspension, or
            termination of your agreement.
          </p>

          <ul>

          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">P4. Confidentiality — Survives Termination</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not disclose Elevate&apos;s curriculum, pricing, operational procedures, or student data to any third party without written authorization.</li>
            <li>You may not use Elevate&apos;s confidential information to develop, support, or operate a competing program.</li>
            <li>These obligations survive termination of this agreement for three (3) years.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-800">P5. Non-Compete and Non-Replication — 3 Years Post-Termination</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>Persistent failure to meet quality standards or credential attainment benchmarks</li>
            <li>Failure to submit required reports or documentation within specified timeframes</li>
