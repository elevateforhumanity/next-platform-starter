          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2 mt-0">1. What Elevate For Humanity Is</h2>
          <p>
            Elevate for Humanity is a workforce development organization based in Indianapolis, Indiana. We provide
            career training, credentialing, and job placement support to job seekers, returning citizens, veterans,
            and underserved communities. We operate as an eligible training provider under Indiana&apos;s INTraining /
            Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) system, administered by the Indiana Department of Workforce
            Development (DWD).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What this means for you:</strong> When you deliver training under the Elevate name, you are
            operating as an authorized delivery site within our Training Network. You are not a co-owner, partner,
            or franchise operator. Elevate owns the programs, the curriculum, the credentials, and the brand.
            You provide the space, the students, or the coordination — depending on your tier.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">2. Your Role as a Program Holder</h2>
          <p>
            A Program Holder is an organization or individual authorized to host or support delivery of Elevate
            training programs at an approved site. Your specific responsibilities depend on which participation
            tier you signed under (see Section 5). In all cases, Program Holders are responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Student Recruitment:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining enrollment levels through outreach, marketing, and community partnerships. Elevate does not guarantee a pipeline of students to your site.</li>
            <li><strong>WorkOne Registration (REQUIRED for WIOA-funded students):</strong> All students seeking WIOA funding must be registered through WorkOne before enrollment. This is a federal compliance requirement — not optional. Failure to complete WorkOne registration can result in loss of funding for those students.</li>
            <li><strong>Attendance Tracking:</strong> Recording and submitting student attendance to Elevate within 48 hours of each session. Attendance records are required for compliance reporting and payment processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Facility Readiness (Tier 1 only):</strong> Maintaining a safe, accessible, and properly equipped training space for the full cohort duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Responding to Elevate staff inquiries within 48 hours and reporting any student issues, safety concerns, or compliance problems immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Document Submission:</strong> Keeping all required documents current (see Section 3).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">3. Required Documents — No Exceptions</h2>
          <div className="not-prose bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 rounded-r-lg mb-4 flex gap-3">
            <AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5 text-yellow-700 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5" />
            <p className="text-yellow-900 font-semibold text-sm">
              You cannot enroll students or receive payments until ALL required documents are submitted and
              approved. This is not negotiable. There are no exceptions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>State Business License</strong> — Current and valid license to operate in your state.</li>
            <li><strong>Training Provider License</strong> — State-issued license to operate as a training provider, if required for your industry or program type.</li>
            <li><strong>Facility Inspection Certificate</strong> — Proof that your training space meets state safety and ADA accessibility standards (Tier 1 only).</li>
            <li><strong>Instructor Credentials</strong> — Copies of all instructor licenses, certifications, and relevant qualifications for each program you will deliver.</li>
            <li><strong>General Liability Insurance</strong> — Certificate of insurance showing minimum $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate. Elevate for Humanity must be named as an additional insured.</li>
            <li><strong>Workers&apos; Compensation Insurance</strong> — Proof of coverage for all employees who will be present at the training site.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Checks</strong> — Criminal background checks for all staff who will have direct contact with students.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal EIN / Tax ID</strong> — Your Federal Employer Identification Number.</li>
            <li><strong>W-9 Form</strong> — Required for payment processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Approved Curriculum</strong> — Confirmation that you will use Elevate&apos;s curriculum exclusively. You may not substitute, supplement, or modify it without written authorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment Inventory</strong> — List of training equipment and tools available to students (Tier 1 only).</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
            Documents must be renewed annually or whenever they expire. Lapsed documents will result in
            suspension of enrollment until renewed.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">4. Student Management and FERPA</h2>
          <p>
            All students enrolled in Elevate programs are Elevate students — regardless of which physical site
            delivers their training. Student records, enrollment data, credential progress, and outcome data are
            maintained exclusively by Elevate.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not share student personally identifiable information (PII) with any third party without written student consent and Elevate authorization.</li>
            <li>Student records are protected under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). Violations carry federal penalties.</li>
            <li>You must verify student eligibility before enrollment using Elevate&apos;s intake process — not your own independent process.</li>
            <li>You must document and report any student incidents (safety, conduct, attendance) to Elevate within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>You may not disenroll, dismiss, or transfer a student without Elevate authorization.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">5. Participation and Compensation</h2>
          <p>
            Your compensation structure is defined in your signed Training Network Partner Agreement (MOU).
            Refer to your MOU for the specific terms applicable to your partnership tier.
            Payment terms, milestones, and invoicing requirements are governed exclusively by that agreement.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">6. Compliance Requirements — Federal Law, Not Our Preference</h2>
          <p>
            These requirements exist because Elevate operates under WIOA and Indiana DWD oversight. They are
            federal and state law. They are not negotiable under any circumstances.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>WIOA Nondiscrimination (WIOA Section 188):</strong> You may not discriminate against any student or applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, political affiliation, or citizenship. Violations are reported to the U.S. Department of Labor.</li>
            <li><strong>ADA / Section 504 Accessibility:</strong> Your facility and program must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. This is not optional.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Reporting:</strong> All attendance, enrollment, and outcome data submitted to Elevate must be truthful and complete. Falsifying records is grounds for immediate termination and may result in federal criminal penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Accountability:</strong> Funds received from Elevate may only be used for allowable program costs. Financial records must be maintained for a minimum of 7 years and made available for audit upon request.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit Cooperation:</strong> You must cooperate fully with any audit or monitoring visit conducted by Elevate, Indiana DWD, or any federal oversight agency. Refusal to cooperate is grounds for immediate termination.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">7. Quality Standards</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Qualified Instructors:</strong> All instructors must hold current credentials required for the program they teach. Credentials must be submitted to Elevate before instruction begins. You may not allow an uncredentialed instructor to teach.</li>
            <li><strong>Curriculum:</strong> You must use Elevate&apos;s approved curriculum as delivered. You may not modify, supplement, or replace it without written authorization from Elevate.</li>
            <li><strong>Facility Standards:</strong> Training spaces must be clean, safe, properly equipped, and accessible. Elevate may conduct unannounced site visits to verify standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Student Outcomes:</strong> Program Holders are expected to maintain credential attainment rates consistent with Elevate&apos;s network benchmarks. Persistent underperformance will result in corrective action or termination.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">8. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            By operating as a Program Holder, you receive access to Elevate&apos;s proprietary curriculum, operational
            procedures, student data, financial structures, and business relationships. All of this is confidential.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not disclose Elevate&apos;s curriculum, pricing, operational procedures, or student data to any third party without written authorization.</li>
            <li>You may not use Elevate&apos;s confidential information to develop, support, or operate a competing program.</li>
            <li>Confidentiality obligations survive termination of this agreement for three (3) years.</li>
            <li>A full Non-Disclosure Agreement is available at <strong>/legal/nda</strong> and is incorporated by reference into your MOU.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 border-b pb-2">9. Non-Compete and Non-Replication</h2>
          <p>
            This section protects the program model you are being given access to. It is not punitive — it is
            necessary to protect the integrity of the Training Network and the students it serves.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>During the term of your agreement and for three (3) years following termination, you may not replicate, reproduce, or develop a substantially similar training program using materials, systems, or methods provided through this collaboration.</li>
            <li>You may not solicit or redirect enrolled students, instructors, credential partners, or employers into a competing program derived from the Elevate training model.</li>
            <li>You may not use Elevate&apos;s program structure or credential relationships to apply independently for ETPL status or workforce funding for a competing program.</li>
            <li>A full Non-Compete Agreement is available at <strong>/legal/non-compete</strong> and is incorporated by reference into your MOU.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-slate-500">
            These restrictions do not prevent you from operating your existing business, employing staff, or
            participating in unrelated training programs. They only restrict replication of the Elevate model.
          </p>

          <p><strong>After termination:</strong></p>
