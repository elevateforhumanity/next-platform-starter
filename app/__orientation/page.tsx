              Orientation is the first step after you apply. During this session you will learn how the program works,
              what funding covers your training, what to expect on your first day of class, and how our career services
              team helps you find employment after graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              All orientation sessions are held virtually via Zoom. You do not need to come to a physical location.
              Sessions run approximately 45 minutes and include time for questions. You will receive a confirmation
              email with the Zoom link after you book your session below.

            <p>
              <strong>How the program works:</strong> We explain the full process from enrollment to graduation.
              You will understand exactly what is covered by funding (tuition, books, supplies, certification fees)
              and what you are responsible for (showing up, completing assignments, passing your certification exam).
              There are no hidden costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What to expect on day one:</strong> You will meet your instructors, receive your materials,
              and get a tour of the learning platform. Classes are structured with both classroom instruction and
              hands-on practice. Attendance is mandatory — most programs require 90% or higher attendance to maintain
              funding eligibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How to get the most out of your training:</strong> Students who succeed treat this like a job.
              Show up on time, participate in class, ask questions, and complete all assignments. Your instructors
              are experienced professionals who want to see you pass your certification on the first attempt.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What happens after graduation:</strong> Our career services team begins working with you
              before you graduate. They help with resume writing, interview preparation, and direct referrals to
              employer partners. Most graduates are placed in jobs within 30 days of completing their program.
              Career support is free and available to alumni for life.
