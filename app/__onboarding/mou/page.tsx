During the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years following termination, the Collaborating Party agrees not to:

• Replicate, reproduce, or develop a substantially similar training program using materials, systems, or methods provided through this collaboration
• Solicit or redirect enrolled students, instructors, credential partners, or employers into a competing program derived from the Elevate training model

YOUR RIGHT TO EXIT: Either party — you or Elevate — may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, by providing 30 days written notice. You do not need to provide a reason. You do not need Elevate's permission. Send written notice (email is acceptable) to your assigned Elevate coordinator and copy elevate4humanityedu@gmail.com. Termination takes effect 30 days from the date of notice. This right is non-negotiable and cannot be waived.

During the 30-day notice period, cohorts already in progress continue under this Agreement until completion. You remain responsible for students currently enrolled at your site.

After termination: transfer all student records to Elevate within 10 business days; return all Elevate materials and proprietary documents; submit final attendance reports and invoices within 30 days; Elevate will process outstanding payments owed to you within 30 days of receiving final documentation. Confidentiality and non-compete obligations remain in effect for 3 years after termination.

IMMEDIATE TERMINATION BY ELEVATE (no notice required): Elevate may terminate immediately — without the 30-day notice period — if the Collaborating Party: fails to maintain required insurance, violates federal nondiscrimination requirements, falsifies student records, misrepresents Elevate programs or credentials, represents itself as a partner or co-owner of Elevate, modifies curriculum or tuition without authorization, or creates an immediate safety risk to students.`,
