# Admin Dashboard — Complete Production Spec

## Problem Statement

The admin dashboard has 164 pages. ~26 are stubs with no DB connection. ~39 had no auth guard.
The course builder cannot create new programs from scratch or add lesson content.
There is no unified video management. The admin currently redirects straight to `/admin/dashboard`
with no landing page. The nav is a flat dropdown bar — it needs section headers, sub-groups,
and a full hamburger slide-in panel matching the public marketing site pattern.

---

## Goals

1. **Admin landing page** — `/admin` is a real page (not a redirect), styled like the marketing site
2. **Full nav** — sticky top bar with grouped dropdowns (section headers + sub-items), full hamburger panel on mobile with nested expand/collapse, search, user menu
3. **Every admin page** is production-ready — auth-guarded, wired to Supabase, real data
4. **Course builder** — create programs, modules, lessons, content (text/video/quiz) from scratch
5. **Video management** — upload to Supabase storage, generate via D-ID, or paste external URL
6. **Design** — matches public marketing site: full-bleed hero, big typography, ruled lists, no card grids

---

## Design System (non-negotiable for all pages)

- Full-bleed hero image, no text on top of image
- Page title: `text-4xl sm:text-6xl font-black text-slate-900 leading-none`
- Eyebrow: `text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-widest text-slate-400`
- Section headings: `text-3xl sm:text-5xl font-black`
- Data rows: `divide-y divide-slate-100`, each row a `<Link>` where applicable
- Container: `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Status pills: `rounded-full text-[11px] font-semibold` colored by status
- Buttons: `px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-xl font-semibold`
- Background: always `bg-white` — never `bg-slate-50` page backgrounds
- Mobile-first: all layouts work on 375px phones

---

## Requirement 1 — Admin Landing Page (`/admin`)

Replace the current redirect with a real page that looks like the public home page but shows admin data.

**Sections (top to bottom):**

1. **Hero** — full-bleed image (`/images/pages/admin-dashboard-hero.jpg`), greeting + name below, urgent CTA if pending applications
2. **Quick stats** — 4 large typographic numbers (Applications waiting, Active enrollments, Revenue this month, Certificates issued) as a ruled list — each links to its section
3. **Quick nav grid** — all 10 nav sections as large clickable tiles (Operations, Students, Programs, Build, AI, Funding, Partners, Marketing, Compliance, System) — each tile shows section name, icon, and count of items
4. **Recent activity** — last 10 audit log entries
5. **At-risk students** — top 5 inactive learners

All data fetched server-side from Supabase. Auth-guarded with `requireAdmin()`.

## Requirement 2 — Admin Nav (full rebuild)

### Desktop nav

- Sticky top bar, `z-50`, `h-16`, `bg-white border-b border-slate-200`
- Logo left: Elevate "E" mark + "Elevate Admin" text
- 10 nav groups as dropdown buttons — each dropdown has **section header labels** (styled like the public site: red uppercase label, `bg-brand-red-50 border-l-3 border-brand-red-500`) separating sub-groups
- Dropdowns open on **hover** (CSS `group-hover`) AND click (JS toggle) — matches public site pattern
- Active section highlighted: `text-blue-600 bg-blue-50`
- Right side: search bar, notifications bell with unread badge, username, sign-out

### Mobile hamburger panel

- Slides in from right, `w-[85vw] max-w-sm`
- Each of the 10 sections is an accordion — tap to expand, shows section headers + links inside
- Section headers styled same as desktop (red uppercase label)
- Search bar at top
- Sign out at bottom
- Overlay closes panel on tap
- `Escape` key closes panel
- `style={{ transform }}` (not className template literal) to avoid hydration mismatch

- Progress bar during upload
- On complete → writes URL to `curriculum_lessons.video_url`

### 5b. D-ID Generation

- Form: lesson select, script text, avatar (default: instructor-trades.jpg)
- POST to D-ID API via existing integration
- Polls job status → writes result to `curriculum_lessons.video_url`
- Job status tracked in `video_generation_jobs` table

## Requirement 6 — Auth sweep

Every admin page must have `requireAdmin()` (server) or `AdminClientPage` wrapper (client).
No page in `/app/admin/**` is accessible without admin role.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/admin` is a real landing page — not a redirect — with live DB data
- [ ] Nav has section headers in dropdowns matching the public site pattern
- [ ] Mobile hamburger panel has accordion sections with section headers
- [ ] Every admin page returns 403/redirect for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Every stub page shows real Supabase data (or clear empty state)
- [ ] Admin can create program → add modules → add lessons → add content without code
- [ ] Admin can attach video via upload, D-ID, or URL
- [ ] `/admin/video-manager` lists all lesson videos with replace/remove
- [ ] All pages match marketing site design (no card grids, no sidebar aesthetic)
- [ ] Zero hydration errors
- [ ] Dev server starts clean

---

## Implementation Order

1. Auth sweep — `requireAdmin()` on all unguarded pages
2. Admin landing page (`/admin/page.tsx`) — hero + stats + quick nav + activity
3. AdminNav rebuild — section headers in dropdowns, hover+click, mobile accordion
4. Stub pages — all 20 wired to Supabase as production server components
5. Course builder — create program form + API route
6. Course builder — module/lesson management UI
7. Lesson content editor — inline tabs (Content, Video, Quiz, Settings)
8. Video upload — Supabase storage with progress
9. D-ID video generation — form + polling + status
10. External URL video — input + save
11. Video manager page — full list with replace/remove
12. Verify — dev server clean, all pages load, all DB queries return data
