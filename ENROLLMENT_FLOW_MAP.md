# Enrollment Flow Map — Start to Finish

## Overview

Every user follows a linear funnel from discovery to certification. The flow has 6 stages with clear handoffs between each.

```
DISCOVER → INQUIRE → APPLY → ENROLL → LEARN → CERTIFY
```

---

## Stage 1: DISCOVER (Public Site)

**Entry points:**

- Homepage (`/`) → "Programs" or "Apply Now" buttons
- `/programs` → Browse all program categories
- `/programs/{category}` → Healthcare, Skilled Trades, Beauty, etc.
- `/programs/{slug}` → Individual program detail page

**What happens:** User browses programs, reads details, sees career outcomes and funding info.

**Exit to next stage:** Every program page has an "Apply Now" CTA that routes to Stage 3 (Apply), or an "Inquiry" link for Stage 2.

**Routes:**
| Page | CTA | Destination |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `/programs` | "Start Eligibility & Apply" | `/apply` |
| `/programs/barber-apprenticeship` | "Apply Now" | `/apply?program=barber-apprenticeship` |
| `/programs/cna-certification` | "Apply Now" | `/apply?program=cna-certification` |
| `/programs/hvac-technician` | "Apply Now" | `/apply?program=hvac-technician` |
| `/programs/{any-slug}` (template) | "Apply Now" | `/apply?program={slug}` |

---

## Stage 2: INQUIRE (Optional — Information Request)

**Purpose:** For users not ready to apply. Submits contact info for follow-up.

**Flow:**

```
/programs/{slug} → "Request Info"
    ↓
/inquiry?program={slug}  (form with program pre-selected)
    ↓
/inquiry/success  (confirmation + links to Apply and Programs)
```

**Program-specific shortcuts:**

- `/programs/barber-apprenticeship/inquiry` → redirects to `/inquiry?program=barber-apprenticeship`
- `/programs/cosmetology-apprenticeship/inquiry` → redirects to `/inquiry?program=cosmetology-apprenticeship`

**What happens after:** Admissions team contacts user within 1-2 business days. User can also proceed directly to Apply.

---

## Stage 3: APPLY (Application Submission)

**Two paths based on program type:**

### Path A: Standard Programs (most programs)

```
/apply?program={slug}
    ↓
/apply  (routing page — detects program, redirects)
    ↓
/apply/student?program={slug}  (full application form)
    ↓
/apply/success  (confirmation + next steps)
```

### Path B: Apprenticeship Programs (barber, cosmetology, nail-tech)

```
/apply?program=barber-apprenticeship
    ↓
/programs/barber-apprenticeship/apply  (dedicated form with pricing calculator)
    ↓
/programs/barber-apprenticeship/apply/success  (confirmation)
```

**Programs with dedicated apply pages:**
| Program | Dedicated Apply Page |
|---------|---------------------|
| Barber Apprenticeship | `/programs/barber-apprenticeship/apply` |
| Cosmetology Apprenticeship | `/programs/cosmetology-apprenticeship/apply` → redirects to `/apply?program=cosmetology-apprenticeship` |
| CPR/First Aid | `/programs/cpr-first-aid-hsi/apply` |
| Culinary Apprenticeship | `/programs/culinary-apprenticeship/apply` |
| Electrical | `/programs/electrical/apply` |
| Medical Assistant | `/programs/medical-assistant/apply` |
| Plumbing | `/programs/plumbing/apply` |
| Sanitation & Infection Control | `/programs/sanitation-infection-control/apply` |
| Welding | `/programs/welding/apply` |

**All other programs** use the generic `/apply/student?program={slug}` form.

**What happens after:** Application is reviewed by admissions (1-2 business days). User receives email/call.

---

## Stage 4: ENROLL (Payment + Confirmation)

**Two paths based on program funding:**

### Path A: Funded Programs (WIOA/WRG/JRI)

```
/apply/success  (admissions reviews, approves funding)
    ↓
[Email notification: "You're approved"]
    ↓
/enroll/{programId}  (enrollment confirmation page)
    ↓
/enroll/success  (access unlocked → Student Portal)
```

### Path B: Self-Pay / Apprenticeship Programs

```
/apply/success  (admissions reviews application)
    ↓
[Email: "Application approved — complete enrollment"]
    ↓
/enroll/{programId}  (payment via Stripe checkout)
    ↓
/enroll/confirmation?session_id=xxx  (payment verified)
    ↓
/programs/{slug}/enrollment-success  (enrollment confirmed)
```

**Apprenticeship-specific enrollment success pages:**
| Program | Enrollment Success | Next Step |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Barber | `/programs/barber-apprenticeship/enrollment-success` | → Orientation |
| Cosmetology | `/programs/cosmetology-apprenticeship/enrollment-success` | → Orientation |
| Nail Technician | `/programs/nail-technician-apprenticeship/enrollment-success` | → Orientation |

---

## Stage 5: ONBOARD (Orientation + Documents)

**Apprenticeship programs have a structured onboarding flow:**

```
/programs/{slug}/enrollment-success
    ↓  "Start Orientation"
/programs/{slug}/orientation  (5-section walkthrough)
    ↓  "Continue to Program"
/programs/{slug}/documents  (upload government ID + optional docs)
    ↓  "Submit Documents"
/apprentice  (Apprentice Dashboard — training begins)
```

**Orientation sections (all apprenticeships):**

1. What This Program Leads To
2. How the Apprenticeship Works
3. Attendance & Conduct Expectations
4. Payment Terms
5. Compliance & Agreement (checkbox acknowledgment required)

**Standard programs onboarding:**

```
/enroll/success
    ↓  "Start Onboarding Now"
/student-portal/onboarding  (document upload)
    ↓
/student/dashboard  (Student Dashboard — training begins)
```

**Programs with full onboarding flow:**
| Program | Orientation | Documents | Dashboard |
|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Barber Apprenticeship | ✅ | ✅ | `/apprentice` |
| Cosmetology Apprenticeship | ✅ | ✅ | `/apprentice` |
| Nail Technician Apprenticeship | ✅ | ✅ | `/apprentice` |
| All other programs | — | via `/student-portal/onboarding` | `/student/dashboard` |

---

## Stage 6: LEARN + CERTIFY (LMS)

    ↓
Module-based learning (sequential)
    ↓
Progress tracking (percentage complete)

**"Full"** = Has dedicated orientation, documents, and enrollment-success pages.

## Fixes Applied

1. **`[slug]` fallback page** — CTA now passes `?program={slug}` instead of bare `/apply`
2. **`ProgramTemplate.tsx`** — All CTAs now include `?program={slug}`
3. **`VisualProgramTemplate.tsx`** — All CTAs now include `?program={slug}`
4. **`tax-entrepreneurship/page.tsx`** — CTAs now route to `?program=tax-prep-financial-services`
5. **`direct-support-professional/page.tsx`** — Primary CTA now includes program param
6. **`cosmetology-apprenticeship`** — Added full enrollment sub-pages (inquiry, eligibility, apply, apply/success, enrollment-success, orientation, documents)
7. **`cosmetology-apprenticeship`** — Added to orientation config with program-specific details
8. **`cosmetology-apprenticeship`** — Added `dedicatedApplyPage` to program registry
9. **`inquiry/success`** — Added "Ready to Apply?" and "Browse Programs" CTAs (was a dead end)
10. **`nail-technician-apprenticeship`** — CTA updated to use canonical slug
