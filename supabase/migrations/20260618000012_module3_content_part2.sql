<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will distinguish the purpose of each cutting tool, explain when to use shear-over-comb vs. clipper-over-comb, and identify common tool misuse errors and their consequences.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each tool has a specific purpose — misuse creates technical problems</li>
  <li><strong>Shears</strong> — precision cutting, layering, shaping, and refinement</li>
  <li><strong>Clippers</strong> — bulk removal, tapers, fades, and short-form work</li>
  <li><strong>Trimmers</strong> — outlining, edging, detailing, and close finishing</li>
  <li>Shear-over-comb and clipper-over-comb are advanced control techniques for transitions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Comb Techniques</h4>
<p><strong>Shear-over-comb</strong>: The comb lifts the hair away from the scalp and the shears cut across the teeth of the comb. Used for blending, removing bulk without hard lines, and refining transitions. Requires consistent comb angle and controlled hand movement.</p>
<p><strong>Clipper-over-comb</strong>: The comb lifts the hair and the clipper cuts across it. Used for the same purpose as shear-over-comb but faster and more efficient on shorter hair. The comb angle controls the amount of hair removed — a flatter comb angle removes less; a steeper angle removes more.</p>

<h4>Common Misuse Errors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using clippers where shears are needed → loses refinement, creates choppy texture</li>
  <li>Using shears where clippers are more efficient → loses consistency, wastes time</li>
  <li>Using trimmers for bulk removal → creates hard lines and uneven length</li>
  <li>Inconsistent comb angle during comb techniques → creates ridges and uneven blends</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A barber tries to refine a parietal ridge transition using only a clipper guard. The result stays bulky because the guard cannot follow the curve of the head precisely. Switching to clipper-over-comb allows the barber to follow the head shape and remove the excess weight precisely without creating a hard line.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shears = precision and refinement; clippers = bulk and speed; trimmers = detail and outline</li>
  <li>Comb techniques (shear-over-comb, clipper-over-comb) remove weight without hard lines</li>
  <li>Tool misuse creates technical problems that technique alone cannot fix</li>
  <li>Consistent comb angle is the key variable in both comb techniques</li>
</ul>

    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Fading, Tapering, and Blending</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will distinguish between a fade and a taper, explain the mechanics of guard progression, identify the causes of hard lines, and describe the correct approach to removing them.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fade</strong> — a gradual transition from very short (or skin) to longer hair over a defined area</li>
  <li><strong>Taper</strong> — a softer, lower-profile reduction of length, typically at the neckline and around the ears</li>
  <li><strong>Blend</strong> — the removal of visible lines between lengths</li>
  <li><strong>Guard progression</strong> — the systematic use of increasing guard sizes to create smooth transitions</li>
  <li>Hard lines are caused by poor guard progression, inconsistent wrist motion, or trying to remove too much at once</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>Fade vs. Taper</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th></th><th>Fade</th><th>Taper</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Starting length</td><td>Skin or very close (0–0.5 guard)</td><td>Short but not skin (1–2 guard)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Transition area</td><td>Wider, more dramatic</td><td>Narrower, more subtle</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Finish</td><td>High contrast or mid-fade depending on placement</td><td>Natural, conservative finish</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Common use</td><td>Modern barbershop styles</td><td>Professional and conservative styles</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Guard Progression Mechanics</h4>
<p>A fade is not random guard switching. It is controlled length progression across a defined transition area. The barber must know three things before starting: where the shortest area begins, where the weight line sits, and how each guard size relates to the next.</p>
<p>Standard progression example (low fade): skin → 0.5 → 1 → 1.5 → 2 → blend into top length. Each guard removes a defined amount of length. Skipping guards creates visible lines. Overlapping guards in the wrong direction creates ridges.</p>

<h4>Removing Hard Lines</h4>
<p>Hard lines appear when there is an abrupt length change between two guard sizes. The fix is not to re-cut with the same guard — it is to use the intermediate guard in the transition zone with a flicking wrist motion to feather the line out. Patience and system, not speed, produce clean fades.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A student creates a harsh line between a 1 and a 2 guard. Instead of jumping to random guards, the correct approach is to identify the exact location of the line, use a 1.5 guard (or open the 1 guard lever slightly) in that zone with a controlled flicking motion, and work the transition until the line disappears. Rushing this step is the most common fade mistake.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fade = dramatic transition from skin or very short; taper = subtle, conservative reduction</li>
  <li>Guard progression must be systematic — skipping guards creates hard lines</li>
  <li>Hard lines are fixed with intermediate guards and controlled flicking motion</li>
  <li>Fading requires system and patience — speed is the enemy of a clean blend</li>

  -- Lesson 20: Head Shape, Face Shape, and Cut Selection
  UPDATE public.course_lessons SET
    title       = 'Head Shape, Face Shape, and Cut Selection',
    video_url   = '/videos/barber-lessons/barber-apprenticeship-intro.mp4',
    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Head Shape, Face Shape, and Cut Selection</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will identify the key anatomical landmarks of the head, describe how face shape influences cut selection, and explain how growth patterns affect the finished result.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Parietal ridge</strong> — the widest part of the head; where the side meets the top</li>
  <li><strong>Occipital bone</strong> — the bone at the back of the skull; affects neckline shape</li>
  <li><strong>Crown</strong> — the top-back area of the head; often has strong growth patterns</li>
  <li>Face shape guides cut selection — the goal is to create visual balance</li>
  <li>Growth patterns (cowlicks, strong crowns) must be respected, not fought</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>Head Anatomy Landmarks</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Landmark</th><th>Location</th><th>Relevance to Cutting</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Parietal ridge</td><td>Widest point of the head, side-to-top junction</td><td>Key reference for fade height and weight line placement</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Occipital bone</td><td>Prominent bone at the back of the skull</td><td>Determines neckline shape and taper placement</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Crown</td><td>Top-back of the head</td><td>Strong growth patterns here affect finish and control</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Temporal area</td><td>Side of the head above the ear</td><td>Common location for fade transitions</td></tr>

<h4>Face Shape and Cut Selection</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Face Shape</th><th>Characteristics</th><th>Cut Strategy</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Oval</td><td>Balanced proportions</td><td>Most styles work — maintain natural balance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Round</td><td>Equal width and length</td><td>Add height on top; keep sides close to elongate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Square</td><td>Strong jawline, equal width</td><td>Soften corners; avoid very square perimeters</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Oblong / Long</td><td>Longer than wide</td><td>Add width at sides; avoid excessive height on top</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Diamond</td><td>Narrow forehead and chin, wide cheekbones</td><td>Add width at forehead and chin; reduce width at cheekbones</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Growth Patterns</h4>
<p>Cowlicks, strong crowns, and irregular necklines are growth patterns — the direction hair naturally grows from the follicle. These cannot be permanently changed by cutting. A barber who fights a growth pattern will produce a cut that looks good in the chair and wrong by the next morning. The correct approach is to design the cut to work with the pattern, not against it.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client with a strong crown requests an ultra-smooth finish in that area. You know the crown growth pattern will push the hair back and expose inconsistency within 24 hours. You explain this to the client, design the cut to follow the crown's natural direction, and set the expectation that the crown will always have some movement. The client leaves satisfied because they were informed, not surprised.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Parietal ridge, occipital bone, and crown are the three key anatomical landmarks</li>
  <li>Face shape guides cut selection — the goal is visual balance, not a formula</li>
  <li>Growth patterns cannot be cut away — design with them, not against them</li>
  <li>Technical skill must be paired with visual judgment to produce great results</li>
