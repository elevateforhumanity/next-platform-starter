<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will identify every layer of the hair shaft, understand the anatomy of the hair follicle, and describe the three layers of the scalp.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The hair shaft has three layers: cuticle, cortex, medulla</li>
  <li>The follicle anchors the hair and houses the dermal papilla</li>
  <li>The scalp has three functional layers: epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous</li>
  <li>Sebaceous glands produce sebum — the scalp's natural oil</li>
  <li>Arrector pili muscles cause goosebumps and affect hair texture appearance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Every hair on the human body grows from a follicle embedded in the scalp. Understanding the structure tells you why hair behaves the way it does — and why certain services work or fail.</p>

<h4>The Hair Shaft</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Layer</th><th>Location</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Cuticle</td><td>Outermost</td><td>Overlapping scales that protect the inner layers; determines shine and smoothness</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cortex</td><td>Middle</td><td>Contains melanin (color) and fibrous proteins; determines strength, elasticity, and curl pattern</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Medulla</td><td>Innermost core</td><td>Soft cells; not always present — absent in fine hair</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>The Hair Follicle</h4>
<p>The follicle is the tube-shaped pocket in the dermis from which hair grows. At its base is the <strong>dermal papilla</strong> — a cluster of cells that receives blood supply and nutrients. The papilla controls hair growth. Damage to the papilla can cause permanent hair loss.</p>
<p>The <strong>sebaceous gland</strong> attaches to the follicle and secretes sebum, which lubricates the hair shaft and scalp. Overproduction causes oily scalp; underproduction causes dryness.</p>

<h4>Scalp Layers</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Epidermis</strong> — the outer skin layer you can see and touch</li>
  <li><strong>Dermis</strong> — contains follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and blood vessels</li>
  <li><strong>Subcutaneous layer</strong> — fat and connective tissue that cushions and insulates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client complains their hair feels rough and dull after a recent chemical service. You know the cuticle is the outermost protective layer — when it is raised or damaged by harsh chemicals, the hair loses shine and feels coarse. You recommend a protein treatment to temporarily smooth the cuticle and advise them to use a sulfate-free shampoo going forward.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cuticle = protection and shine; cortex = color and strength; medulla = core (may be absent)</li>
  <li>The dermal papilla feeds the follicle — damage here is permanent</li>
  <li>Sebaceous glands control scalp oil balance</li>
  <li>Scalp layers: epidermis (surface) → dermis (follicles) → subcutaneous (fat)</li>
</ul>

    video_url   = '/videos/course-barber-consultation-narrated.mp4',
    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>The Hair Growth Cycle</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will name and describe all three phases of the hair growth cycle, explain normal daily shedding, and connect cycle knowledge to client consultations.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hair grows in a continuous three-phase cycle: anagen, catagen, telogen</li>
  <li>Anagen is the active growth phase — 85–90% of scalp hairs are here at any time</li>
  <li>Losing 50–100 hairs per day is normal</li>
  <li>Growth rate averages ½ inch per month</li>
  <li>Stress, illness, and nutrition can disrupt the cycle</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Duration</th><th>What Happens</th><th>% of Hairs</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><strong>Anagen</strong> (Growth)</td><td>2–7 years</td><td>Active cell division at the papilla; hair grows ~½ inch/month</td><td>85–90%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Catagen</strong> (Transition)</td><td>2–3 weeks</td><td>Growth stops; follicle shrinks; hair detaches from papilla</td><td>1–2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Telogen</strong> (Resting)</td><td>3–4 months</td><td>Old hair rests; new anagen hair begins pushing it out</td><td>10–15%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Why Cycles Vary</h4>
<p>The length of the anagen phase determines maximum hair length. A person with a 7-year anagen phase can grow hair much longer than someone with a 2-year phase. This is genetic. Scalp hair has the longest anagen phase of any body hair — which is why head hair grows so much longer than eyebrows.</p>

<h4>Disruptions to the Cycle</h4>
<p>Telogen effluvium is a condition where a large number of hairs shift into telogen simultaneously, causing noticeable shedding 2–3 months after a triggering event (illness, surgery, extreme stress, crash dieting). It is usually temporary.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client comes in alarmed — they are losing "handfuls" of hair in the shower. They had COVID-19 three months ago. You recognize this as likely telogen effluvium triggered by illness. You reassure them it is temporary, recommend a gentle scalp massage to stimulate circulation, and advise them to see a dermatologist if shedding continues beyond six months.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Anagen = growth (2–7 years, 85–90% of hairs)</li>
  <li>Catagen = transition (2–3 weeks, follicle shrinks)</li>
  <li>Telogen = rest (3–4 months, old hair sheds)</li>
  <li>50–100 hairs/day shed is normal</li>
  <li>Telogen effluvium = mass shift to telogen after stress or illness — usually temporary</li>

  -- Lesson 10: Hair Texture, Density & Porosity
  UPDATE public.course_lessons SET

    video_url   = '/videos/course-barber-consultation-narrated.mp4',
    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Hair Texture, Density, and Porosity</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will distinguish between hair texture, density, and porosity, explain how each affects service selection, and apply this knowledge during client consultations.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Texture = diameter of a single hair strand (fine, medium, coarse)</li>
  <li>Density = number of hairs per square inch of scalp (low, medium, high)</li>
  <li>Porosity = hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture</li>
  <li>These three properties are independent — a client can have fine hair with high density</li>
  <li>Misreading these properties leads to wrong product and technique choices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>Texture</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Characteristics</th><th>Service Considerations</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Fine</td><td>Small diameter, fragile, can appear limp</td><td>Avoid heavy products; over-processing risk is high</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Medium</td><td>Most common; holds styles well</td><td>Standard techniques apply</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Coarse</td><td>Large diameter, strong, may resist chemicals</td><td>May need longer processing time; handles tension well</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Density</h4>
<p>Density affects how you section and cut. High-density hair requires more thorough sectioning to prevent bulk buildup. Low-density hair may need techniques that add visual fullness rather than remove weight.</p>

<h4>Porosity</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Cuticle State</th><th>Behavior</th><th>Service Impact</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Low</td><td>Tight, compact</td><td>Resists moisture and chemicals</td><td>Longer processing; heat may help open cuticle</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Normal</td><td>Slightly raised</td><td>Absorbs and retains moisture well</td><td>Standard processing times</td></tr>
    <tr><td>High</td><td>Raised or damaged</td><td>Absorbs quickly, loses moisture fast</td><td>Shorter processing; protein treatments recommended</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client with coarse, low-porosity hair wants a relaxer. You know low porosity resists chemical penetration. Applying the relaxer at standard timing will likely under-process. You extend processing time slightly and monitor closely — rather than assuming the standard formula will work.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Texture = strand diameter; affects fragility and product weight</li>
  <li>Density = hairs per square inch; affects sectioning and bulk management</li>
  <li>Porosity = cuticle openness; affects chemical processing and moisture retention</li>
  <li>Always assess all three before recommending a service</li>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will identify the most common scalp conditions encountered in a barbershop, distinguish between contagious and non-contagious conditions, and apply the correct professional response to each.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some scalp conditions are contagious — services must be refused</li>
  <li>Some conditions are non-contagious — services can proceed with care</li>
  <li>Barbers are not physicians — when in doubt, refer</li>
  <li>Performing services on contraindicated conditions exposes the client and barber to harm and liability</li>
  <li>Documentation protects you legally</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Cause</th><th>Contagious?</th><th>Barber Action</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>

    <tr><td>Folliculitis</td><td>Bacterial infection of follicles</td><td>Potentially</td><td>Avoid affected area; refer if widespread</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>The Referral Rule</h4>
<p>If you see open sores, active infection, unusual lesions, or anything you cannot identify — do not perform the service. Document what you observed and refer the client to a physician. This is not optional. It is a professional and legal obligation.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client sits in your chair and you notice circular patches of hair loss with broken-off hairs and slight scaling. This presentation matches tinea capitis. You politely decline the service, explain that you noticed a scalp condition that requires a physician's evaluation, and do not touch the affected area. You sanitize your tools and workstation before the next client.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tinea capitis and head lice = always refuse service</li>
  <li>Dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis = service allowed with care</li>
  <li>When in doubt, refer — never guess on a client's scalp health</li>
  <li>Sanitize tools after any suspected contagious contact</li>

    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Client Consultation</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will conduct a structured client consultation, identify contraindications before beginning a service, and communicate professionally to set accurate expectations.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every service begins with a consultation — no exceptions</li>
  <li>The consultation protects the client and the barber legally</li>
  <li>Open-ended questions reveal more than yes/no questions</li>
  <li>Visual and tactile assessment must accompany verbal intake</li>
  <li>Managing expectations prevents dissatisfaction and disputes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>What to Assess</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Assessment Area</th><th>What to Look For</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Hair texture and density</td><td>Fine/medium/coarse; sparse or thick</td><td>Determines technique and product selection</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Scalp condition</td><td>Dryness, flaking, lesions, redness</td><td>Identifies contraindications before service begins</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Growth patterns</td><td>Cowlicks, strong crown, neckline irregularities</td><td>Affects cut design and finish expectations</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Previous services</td><td>Chemical history, recent cuts</td><td>Prevents over-processing; informs technique</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lifestyle and maintenance</td><td>How client styles at home, time available</td><td>Ensures the cut is realistic for the client's routine</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Communication Technique</h4>
<p>Use open-ended questions: <em>"What are you looking for today?"</em> and <em>"How do you style your hair at home?"</em> These reveal more than <em>"Do you want a fade?"</em></p>
<p>Listen more than you talk. Repeat back what you heard: <em>"So you want to keep length on top but clean up the sides and neckline — is that right?"</em> This confirms understanding before scissors touch hair.</p>

<h4>Managing Expectations</h4>
<p>If a client's desired result is not achievable with their current hair — due to texture, damage, or growth pattern — explain why clearly and offer realistic alternatives. Never promise results you cannot deliver. A disappointed client who was warned is far less damaging than a disappointed client who was not.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client shows you a photo of a tight, defined curl pattern they want to achieve. Their hair is straight and fine. Instead of attempting the impossible, you explain that the style in the photo requires a different hair type, show them what is achievable with their hair, and offer a style that complements their natural texture. The client leaves satisfied because expectations were set correctly.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Consultation is mandatory — it protects both parties</li>
  <li>Assess texture, density, scalp, growth patterns, and history before touching hair</li>
  <li>Open-ended questions and active listening prevent miscommunication</li>
  <li>Set realistic expectations — never overpromise</li>

</table>

<h4>Shampoo Procedure (8 Steps)</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Drape client with towel and cape</li>
  <li>Position client at shampoo bowl</li>
  <li>Test water temperature on your wrist before applying to client</li>
  <li>Wet hair thoroughly from roots to ends</li>
  <li>Apply shampoo — amount based on hair density</li>
  <li>Work into lather using rotary massage movements with fingertip pads (never nails)</li>
  <li>Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear</li>
  <li>Apply conditioner if indicated; rinse; towel dry gently</li>
</ol>

<h4>Scalp Massage Movements</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Effleurage</strong> — light, gliding strokes; used to begin and end the massage</li>
  <li><strong>Petrissage</strong> — kneading movements; stimulates circulation and relaxes muscle tension</li>
  <li><strong>Rotary</strong> — circular movements with fingertip pads; primary movement during shampooing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client with an oily scalp and color-treated hair presents a conflict: clarifying shampoo would address the oil but strip the color. You select a gentle sulfate-free shampoo with a clarifying rinse on the scalp only, protecting the color-treated lengths while addressing the oiliness at the root.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Match shampoo to hair type and scalp condition — not habit</li>
  <li>Always test water temperature on your wrist first</li>
