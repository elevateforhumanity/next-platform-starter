<p>OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) sets the standards that protect you and your clients from workplace hazards.</p>
<h3>Bloodborne Pathogens</h3>
<p>Bloodborne pathogens are microorganisms in human blood that can cause disease. In barbering, the primary risks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuts from razors or clippers</li>
<li>Contact with open wounds or sores</li>
<li>Improper disposal of sharps</li>
</ul>
<h3>Universal Precautions</h3>
<p>Treat all blood and bodily fluids as potentially infectious. Always wear gloves when there is risk of contact with blood.</p>
<h3>Sharps Disposal</h3>
<p>Used razor blades must be placed in a puncture-resistant sharps container — never in a regular trash can.</p>$html$::text),

<h3>Sanitation</h3>
<p>Sanitation reduces the number of pathogens on a surface to a safe level. Example: washing hands with soap and water, wiping down a chair with a clean cloth.</p>
<h3>Disinfection</h3>
<p>Disinfection destroys most pathogens on non-living surfaces. In Indiana, barbershops must use an EPA-registered disinfectant on all tools between clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immerse metal tools in disinfectant solution for the manufacturer's recommended time</li>
<li>Combs and brushes must be fully submerged</li>
<li>Disinfectant solution must be changed daily or when visibly contaminated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sterilization</h3>
<p>Sterilization destroys all microorganisms including spores. Autoclave sterilization is the gold standard but not required for most barbershop tools.</p>$html$::text),

<li>Fully immerse in EPA-registered disinfectant</li>
<li>Remove after required contact time and allow to air dry</li>
<li>Store in a clean, covered container</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Service</h3>
<p>Repeat the same process after every client. Never use the same tool on a second client without disinfecting first.</p>
<h3>Indiana State Board Requirements</h3>
<p>The Indiana Professional Licensing Agency requires all barbershops to maintain a disinfection log. Tools found undisinfected during inspection result in immediate citation.</p>$html$::text),

<h3>The Hair Shaft</h3>
<p>Each hair strand has three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cuticle</strong> — the outermost layer; overlapping scales that protect the hair</li>
<li><strong>Cortex</strong> — the middle layer; contains melanin (color) and determines strength and elasticity</li>
<li><strong>Medulla</strong> — the innermost core; not always present in fine hair</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Hair Follicle</h3>
<p>The follicle is the pocket in the scalp from which hair grows. It contains the dermal papilla, which supplies blood and nutrients to the hair root.</p>
<h3>Scalp Layers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Epidermis — outer skin layer</li>
<li>Dermis — contains follicles, sebaceous glands, and blood vessels</li>
<li>Subcutaneous layer — fat and connective tissue</li>
</ul>$html$::text),

    content = to_jsonb($html$<h2>The Hair Growth Cycle</h2>
<p>Hair grows in a continuous cycle with three distinct phases:</p>
<h3>Anagen (Growth Phase)</h3>
<p>Active growth phase lasting 2–7 years. About 85% of scalp hairs are in anagen at any time. Hair grows approximately 1/2 inch per month.</p>
<h3>Catagen (Transition Phase)</h3>
<p>A short transitional phase lasting 2–3 weeks. The follicle shrinks and detaches from the dermal papilla.</p>
<h3>Telogen (Resting Phase)</h3>
<p>The resting phase lasting 3–4 months. The old hair is shed and a new anagen hair begins to grow. Losing 50–100 hairs per day is normal.</p>
<h3>Why This Matters for Barbers</h3>
<p>Understanding the growth cycle helps explain why haircuts grow out at different rates and why some clients experience thinning.</p>$html$::text),

<h3>Texture</h3>
<p>Hair texture refers to the diameter of the individual hair strand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fine</strong> — small diameter, fragile, can be limp</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> — most common, holds styles well</li>
<li><strong>Coarse</strong> — large diameter, strong, may resist chemical services</li>
</ul>
<h3>Density</h3>
<p>Density is the number of hairs per square inch of scalp. Low, medium, or high density affects how you section and cut hair.</p>
<h3>Porosity</h3>
<p>Porosity is the hair's ability to absorb moisture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low porosity</strong> — cuticle is tight; resists moisture and chemicals</li>
<li><strong>Normal porosity</strong> — absorbs and retains moisture well</li>
<li><strong>High porosity</strong> — damaged cuticle; absorbs quickly but loses moisture fast</li>

<h3>Dandruff (Pityriasis)</h3>
<p>Excessive shedding of dead scalp cells. Can be treated with medicated shampoos. Not contagious.</p>
<h3>Seborrheic Dermatitis</h3>
<p>Inflammatory condition causing red, flaky, greasy patches. More severe than dandruff. Refer to a dermatologist for persistent cases.</p>
<h3>Tinea Capitis (Ringworm)</h3>
<p>A fungal infection of the scalp. Highly contagious. Do NOT perform services — refer to a physician immediately.</p>
<h3>Alopecia</h3>
<p>Hair loss that can be caused by genetics, stress, hormones, or autoimmune conditions. Androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) is the most common type.</p>
<h3>Psoriasis</h3>
<p>Autoimmune condition causing thick, silvery scales. Not contagious. Services can be performed if skin is not broken.</p>$html$::text),

<li>Scalp condition — any contraindications?</li>
<li>Client's desired style and lifestyle</li>
<li>Previous chemical services</li>
<li>Allergies or sensitivities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communication Skills</h3>
<p>Use open-ended questions: "What are you looking for today?" and "How do you style your hair at home?" Listen more than you talk.</p>
<h3>Managing Expectations</h3>
<p>If a client's desired style is not achievable with their hair type, explain why and offer realistic alternatives. Never promise results you cannot deliver.</p>$html$::text),

<li><strong>Corded clippers</strong> — consistent power, best for heavy-duty cutting</li>
<li><strong>Cordless clippers</strong> — freedom of movement, requires charging</li>
<li><strong>Detachable blade clippers</strong> — blades swap out for different lengths</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guard Sizes</h3>
<p>Guards (also called attachments) control cutting length:</p>
<ul>
<li>#0 (no guard) — closest cut, skin fade</li>
<li>#1 — 1/8 inch</li>
<li>#2 — 1/4 inch</li>
<li>#3 — 3/8 inch</li>
<li>#4 — 1/2 inch</li>
<li>#7 and #8 — longer lengths for bulk removal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trimmers</h3>
<p>Trimmers (T-liners) are used for edging, lining, and detail work. They have a narrower blade than clippers.</p>$html$::text),

<li><strong>Straight shears</strong> — standard cutting, 5.5–7 inches, most common</li>
<li><strong>Thinning shears</strong> — one serrated blade; removes bulk without changing length</li>
<li><strong>Texturizing shears</strong> — both blades serrated; adds texture and movement</li>
<li><strong>Curved shears</strong> — for curved cuts and blending</li>
</ul>
<h3>Proper Grip</h3>
<p>Thumb in the thumb ring, ring finger in the finger ring. Keep the pinky on the finger rest. Move only the thumb — the bottom blade stays still.</p>
<h3>Shear Maintenance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil the pivot screw daily</li>
<li>Have shears professionally sharpened every 3–6 months</li>
<li>Never drop shears — misaligns the blades</li>
<li>Store in a protective case</li>

<h3>Straight Razor (Cut-Throat Razor)</h3>
<p>The traditional barber's razor. Requires skill and practice. Used for shaving, edging, and razor cutting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be stropped before each use to align the blade edge</li>
<li>Honed periodically to restore sharpness</li>
<li>Never used on a client with skin infections or open wounds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shavette (Disposable Blade Straight Razor)</h3>
<p>Uses replaceable blades — the professional standard for sanitation. Each blade is used once and disposed of in a sharps container.</p>
<h3>Safety Razor</h3>
<p>Double-edge safety razor with a guard bar. Less aggressive than a straight razor. Good for beginners learning shaving technique.</p>
<h3>Razor Safety Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always cut with the grain on the first pass</li>
<li>Keep the skin taut with your free hand</li>
<li>Never leave a razor open and unattended</li>

<li>Apply 2–3 drops of clipper oil to the blade while running</li>
<li>Wipe excess oil with a clean cloth</li>
<li>Spray blades with disinfectant spray between clients</li>
</ol>
<h3>Blade Alignment</h3>
<p>If clippers are pulling or cutting unevenly, the blades may need alignment. The top blade should sit slightly behind the bottom blade — never extend past it.</p>
<h3>Blade Sharpening</h3>
<p>Dull blades pull hair instead of cutting cleanly. Have blades professionally sharpened or replaced every 3–6 months depending on use.</p>
<h3>Motor Care</h3>
<p>Never submerge clippers in liquid. Keep vents clear of hair buildup. Store in a dry location.</p>$html$::text),

<li>Hold the comb flat against the head at the desired angle</li>
<li>Lift the comb slightly to expose the hair to be cut</li>
<li>Run the clipper along the top of the comb in a smooth, continuous motion</li>
<li>Work in sections, overlapping each pass slightly</li>

<ol>
<li>Comb hair upward or outward from the head</li>
<li>Position the comb at the desired length</li>
<li>Cut along the top of the comb with the shears</li>
<li>Work in consistent sections</li>

<h3>Point Cutting</h3>
<p>Point cutting (cutting into the ends at an angle) removes weight and adds texture. Hold shears vertically and make small snips into the hair ends.</p>
<h3>Slide Cutting</h3>
<p>Slide cutting thins and tapers hair by sliding the open shears down the hair shaft. Used for blending and removing bulk.</p>$html$::text),

<h3>Razor Angle</h3>
<p>Hold the razor at a 30-degree angle to the skin. Too steep causes cuts; too flat causes drag.</p>
<h3>The Three-Pass Shave</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>First pass — with the grain (WTG)</strong>: Follow the direction of hair growth. Removes most of the beard.</li>
<li><strong>Second pass — across the grain (XTG)</strong>: Cut perpendicular to growth. Closer result.</li>
<li><strong>Third pass — against the grain (ATG)</strong>: Closest shave. Only for clients with no sensitivity.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skin Stretching</h3>
<p>Use your free hand to keep the skin taut at all times. Loose skin causes nicks and uneven shaving.</p>
<h3>Stroke Technique</h3>
<p>Use short, controlled strokes. Rinse the blade after every 2–3 strokes. Never drag the razor.</p>$html$::text),

<li><strong>Neckline</strong> — two finger-widths above the Adam's apple; the most common mistake is setting it too high</li>

<p>Hair color is measured on a scale of 1 (black) to 10 (lightest blonde). Lifting hair requires removing existing pigment with developer.</p>
<h3>Types of Hair Color</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary</strong> — coats the cuticle; washes out in 1-2 shampoos</li>
<li><strong>Semi-permanent</strong> — no developer; lasts 4-6 weeks</li>
<li><strong>Demi-permanent</strong> — low-volume developer; lasts 6-8 weeks</li>

<li><strong>No-lye relaxers (guanidine)</strong> — gentler, less scalp irritation</li>
<li><strong>Texturizers</strong> — same chemistry, shorter processing time; loosens curl without fully straightening</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never apply to a scratched or irritated scalp</li>
<li>Base the scalp with petroleum jelly before application</li>
<li>Process only to the manufacturer's recommended time</li>
<li>Neutralize thoroughly — stops the chemical process</li>

<h3>Booth Rental</h3>
<p>You pay the shop owner a weekly or monthly fee to use a chair. You keep 100% of your service revenue. You are self-employed — responsible for your own taxes, supplies, and clients.</p>
<h3>Shop Ownership</h3>
<p>You own the business. Maximum income potential but maximum responsibility. Requires business license, shop license, and significant startup capital.</p>
