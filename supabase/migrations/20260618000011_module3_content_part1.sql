<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will define the five foundational principles of haircutting, explain how each affects the finished result, and apply them to describe why a haircut succeeds or fails technically.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Form</strong> — the overall three-dimensional shape of the haircut</li>
  <li><strong>Line</strong> — the visual edge or outline that defines the silhouette</li>
  <li><strong>Balance</strong> — the symmetrical or intentionally asymmetrical relationship between sides</li>
  <li><strong>Guideline</strong> — the section of hair that determines how long the next section is cut</li>
  <li><strong>Tension</strong> — the amount of pull applied to the hair during cutting; affects length accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>Why Principles Matter</h4>
<p>Haircutting is not the random removal of length. It is the controlled removal of length to create a specific shape, balance, and movement. Every decision — where to cut, how much to remove, which angle to hold — is a design decision. A barber who works from principles can reproduce results consistently. A barber who works from habit cannot.</p>

<h4>The Five Principles</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Principle</th><th>Definition</th><th>Effect on the Cut</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Form</td><td>The 3D shape of the finished haircut</td><td>Determines whether the cut looks round, square, layered, or graduated</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Line</td><td>The visual edge — straight, curved, diagonal, or horizontal</td><td>Creates the silhouette and perimeter shape</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Balance</td><td>Equal or intentionally unequal weight on both sides</td><td>Symmetrical cuts require matched sides; asymmetrical cuts require deliberate imbalance</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Guideline</td><td>The reference section that controls all subsequent sections</td><td>Determines consistency — a bad guideline produces a bad cut regardless of technique</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tension</td><td>The pull applied to hair before cutting</td><td>Inconsistent tension produces uneven lengths even when the angle is correct</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Guideline Types</h4>
<p>A <strong>stationary guideline</strong> stays in one place. All subsequent sections are brought to it. This creates increasing length as you move away from the guide — used in one-length and graduated cuts.</p>
<p>A <strong>traveling guideline</strong> moves with each new section. A small amount of the previously cut section is included in the next section as the new guide. This creates uniform layering throughout the cut.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client returns and says their last cut looked different every time. The barber had no system — no consistent guideline, no controlled tension. You establish a stationary guideline at the perimeter, maintain even tension on every section, and the result is reproducible. The client notices the difference immediately.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Form, line, balance, guideline, and tension are the five foundational principles</li>
  <li>A guideline controls consistency — stationary creates graduation, traveling creates uniform layers</li>
  <li>Inconsistent tension produces uneven lengths even with correct angles</li>
  <li>Technical principles make results reproducible, not accidental</li>
</ul>

  -- Lesson 16: Sectioning, Parting, and Control
  UPDATE public.course_lessons SET
    title       = 'Sectioning, Parting, and Control',
    video_url   = '/videos/barber-lessons/barber-apprenticeship-intro.mp4',
    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Sectioning, Parting, and Control</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will explain the difference between sectioning and parting, identify stationary and traveling guidelines in context, and describe how distribution affects weight and shape.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sectioning</strong> — dividing the entire head into workable areas before cutting begins</li>
  <li><strong>Parting</strong> — the individual lines that separate sections within those areas</li>
  <li><strong>Distribution</strong> — the direction hair is combed before cutting; affects weight placement</li>
  <li><strong>Subsection</strong> — a smaller division within a section, used for precision work</li>
  <li>Clean partings prevent overcutting and keep the cut organized</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>Sectioning vs. Parting</h4>
<p>Sectioning is the macro-level organization of the head. Before any cutting begins, the barber divides the head into zones — typically top, sides, and back — using clips or pins. This prevents hair from falling into areas already cut and keeps the work organized.</p>
<p>Parting is the micro-level line within a section. Each parting creates the subsection that will be held and cut. The cleanliness of the parting directly affects the accuracy of the cut. A sloppy parting introduces stray hairs from adjacent sections, creating inconsistency.</p>

<h4>Distribution</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Distribution Type</th><th>Direction</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Natural</td><td>Hair falls in its natural direction</td><td>Preserves natural weight and movement</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Perpendicular</td><td>Hair combed at 90° to the parting</td><td>Creates uniform layering</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Shifted</td><td>Hair combed away from natural fall</td><td>Creates directional weight or asymmetry</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Why Setup Determines Outcome</h4>
<p>Poor sectioning creates poor results even when hand skills are strong. If sections are uneven, the guideline is compromised before the first cut. If partings are sloppy, stray hairs from adjacent sections get cut at the wrong length. The setup is not preparation — it is part of the cut.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A student attempts a fade and layered top without establishing clean sections first. Weight builds unevenly on one side and the blend collapses at the parietal ridge. The problem is not technique — the setup was wrong from the start. Re-sectioning cleanly and re-establishing the guideline corrects the issue.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sectioning = macro organization of the head; parting = micro lines within sections</li>
  <li>Clean partings prevent stray hairs and maintain guideline integrity</li>
  <li>Distribution direction determines where weight sits in the finished cut</li>
  <li>Setup is not separate from the cut — it is the foundation of the cut</li>
</ul>

  -- Lesson 17: Elevation, Angles, and Weight Distribution
  UPDATE public.course_lessons SET
    title       = 'Elevation, Angles, and Weight Distribution',
    video_url   = '/videos/barber-lessons/barber-apprenticeship-intro.mp4',
    content     = to_jsonb($html$<h2>Elevation, Angles, and Weight Distribution</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>By the end of this lesson you will define elevation, identify the four standard elevation angles, predict the weight outcome of each, and explain why angle selection is the most consequential technical decision in haircutting.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Elevation</strong> — the angle at which hair is held from the head before cutting</li>
  <li>Lower elevation = more weight retained; higher elevation = more weight removed</li>
  <li>0° creates a strong weight line; 90° creates uniform layering; 180° creates maximum layering</li>
  <li><strong>Weight line</strong> — the area of maximum weight in a haircut; where hair falls heaviest</li>
  <li>Elevation is independent of guideline — both must be controlled simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<h4>The Four Standard Elevations</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse;width:100%">
  <thead><tr><th>Elevation</th><th>Hair Position</th><th>Weight Result</th><th>Common Use</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>0° (no elevation)</td><td>Hair falls at natural position</td><td>Maximum weight; strong weight line</td><td>One-length cuts, blunt perimeter</td></tr>
    <tr><td>45°</td><td>Hair held halfway between natural fall and perpendicular</td><td>Moderate weight; soft graduation</td><td>Graduated bob, soft layers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>90°</td><td>Hair held perpendicular to the head</td><td>Uniform layering; weight removed evenly</td><td>Uniform layer cuts, round layers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>180°</td><td>Hair held above the head</td><td>Maximum layering; shortest interior, longest perimeter</td><td>Long layers, high-elevation cuts</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Why This Is the Most Important Variable</h4>
<p>Many weak programs teach styles without teaching the mechanical reason the style works. Elevation is that reason. The same guideline, the same parting, the same tension — but a different elevation — produces a completely different haircut. A barber who does not understand elevation is guessing at the outcome of every cut.</p>

<h4>Weight Line Placement</h4>
<p>The weight line is where the hair falls heaviest. At 0° elevation, the weight line sits at the perimeter. As elevation increases, the weight line moves up the head. Understanding where the weight line will land before cutting is what separates technical barbers from stylists who cut by feel.</p>

<h3>Real-World Application</h3>
<p>A client wants softness and movement but the barber cuts everything at 0° elevation. The result is heavy and boxy — the weight line sits at the perimeter and the interior has no movement. Switching to 45° on the sides and 90° on the top removes the excess weight and creates the movement the client wanted. The fix was not a different style — it was a different elevation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Elevation controls weight — lower angle keeps weight, higher angle removes it</li>
  <li>0° = weight line at perimeter; 90° = uniform layers; 180° = maximum layering</li>
  <li>Elevation is the most consequential technical variable in haircutting</li>
  <li>Weight line placement must be planned before cutting begins</li>
</ul>
