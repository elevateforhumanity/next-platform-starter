## A. Program Readiness

| Check                                                    | Status | Notes |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [ ] Program exists in `programs` table                   |        |       |
| [ ] Program has correct `slug` for routing               |        |       |
| [ ] Courses attached to program via `program_courses`    |        |       |
| [ ] All courses are `is_published = true`                |        |       |
| [ ] Enrollment RPC tested for this program               |        |       |
| [ ] Funding type configured (WIOA / self-pay / employer) |        |       |
| [ ] Program duration and hours documented                |        |       |

### Verification Query

```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.name,
  p.slug,
  COUNT(pc.course_id) as course_count,
  COUNT(c.id) FILTER (WHERE c.is_published = true) as published_courses
FROM programs p
LEFT JOIN program_courses pc ON pc.program_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN courses c ON c.id = pc.course_id
WHERE p.slug = 'YOUR_PROGRAM_SLUG'
GROUP BY p.id;
```

**Expected:** `course_count > 0` and `published_courses = course_count`

## B. Partner Readiness (if applicable)

| Check                                                   | Status | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [ ] Partner application approved                        |        |       |
| [ ] `approval_status = 'approved'`                      |        |       |
| [ ] Auth user linked and can log in                     |        |       |
| [ ] Program access granted via `partner_program_access` |        |       |
| [ ] Partner understands approval + retry workflow       |        |       |
| [ ] Partner contact info verified                       |        |       |

### Verification Query

```sql
SELECT
  pa.shop_name,
  pa.approval_status,
  p.account_status,
  pu.user_id IS NOT NULL as has_auth_user,
  COUNT(ppa.program_id) as program_access_count
FROM partner_applications pa
JOIN partners p ON p.id = pa.partner_id
LEFT JOIN partner_users pu ON pu.partner_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN partner_program_access ppa ON ppa.partner_id = p.id
WHERE pa.contact_email = 'partner@example.com'
GROUP BY pa.id, p.id, pu.user_id;
```

**Expected:** `approval_status = 'approved'`, `account_status = 'active'`, `has_auth_user = true`

---

## C. Student Intake Validation

| Check                                        | Status | Notes |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [ ] Application flow tested end-to-end       |        |       |
| [ ] State machine transitions verified       |        |       |

| [ ] Draft persistence working (localStorage) |        |       |
| [ ] Recovery banner appears on refresh       |        |       |
| [ ] Invalid transitions are rejected         |        |       |
| [ ] Submission creates audit log entry       |        |       |

### Test Procedure

1. Start new application
2. Complete Step 1 (Personal Info)
3. Refresh page → verify recovery banner appears
4. Complete all steps to Review
5. Attempt to skip step → verify rejection
6. Accept terms and submit
7. Verify `application_state = 'submitted'` in database
8. Verify audit log entry exists

## D. Enrollment Flow Validation

| Check                                           | Status | Notes |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [ ] `rpc_enroll_student` executes without error |        |       |
| [ ] Program enrollment created                  |        |       |
| [ ] Course enrollments created                  |        |       |
| [ ] Profile status updated to `active`          |        |       |

| [ ] Idempotent retry returns same result        |        |       |

### Test Procedure

```sql
-- Test enrollment (use test user)
SELECT rpc_enroll_student(
  'TEST_USER_UUID'::uuid,
  'PROGRAM_UUID'::uuid,
  'test-cohort-' || gen_random_uuid()::text,
  'cohort_test',
  '{"funding_source": "WIOA"}'::jsonb
);

-- Verify results
SELECT * FROM program_enrollments WHERE student_id = 'TEST_USER_UUID';
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_UUID';
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE details->>'user_id' = 'TEST_USER_UUID' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

---

## E. Notification System Validation

| Check                                                  | Status | Notes |

| [ ] Cron job `/api/cron/process-notifications` working |        |       |

### Test Procedure

```sql
-- Queue test notification
INSERT INTO notification_outbox (to_email, template_key, template_data, status, scheduled_for)
VALUES (
  'admin@example.com',
  'enrollment_welcome',
  '{"name": "Test User", "program_name": "Test Program"}'::jsonb,
  'queued',
  NOW()
);

-- Trigger processing
-- POST /api/cron/process-notifications (with CRON_SECRET)

-- Verify sent
SELECT * FROM notification_outbox WHERE to_email = 'admin@example.com' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

---

## F. Dry Run (MANDATORY)

**This must pass before any real student is onboarded.**

| Step                                     | Status | Notes |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| [ ] 1. Create test student profile       |        |       |
| [ ] 2. Complete application end-to-end   |        |       |
| [ ] 3. Submit successfully               |        |       |
| [ ] 4. Enroll via RPC                    |        |       |
| [ ] 5. Verify courses appear in LMS      |        |       |
| [ ] 6. Verify welcome notification fires |        |       |
| [ ] 7. Clean up test data                |        |       |

### Dry Run Script

```sql
-- 1. Create test profile
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, full_name, role, enrollment_status)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'dryrun_' || gen_random_uuid()::text || '@test.com',
  'Dry Run Test',
  'student',
  'pending'
)
RETURNING id as test_user_id;

-- 2-3. Complete application via UI or RPC
-- (Use the returned test_user_id)

-- 4. Enroll
SELECT rpc_enroll_student(
  'TEST_USER_ID'::uuid,
  'PROGRAM_UUID'::uuid,
  'dryrun-' || NOW()::text,
  'dry_run',
  '{}'::jsonb
);

-- 5. Verify courses
SELECT c.title, e.status
FROM enrollments e
JOIN courses c ON c.id = e.course_id
WHERE e.user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';

-- 6. Verify notification
SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';

-- 7. Cleanup
DELETE FROM notifications WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';
DELETE FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';
DELETE FROM program_enrollments WHERE student_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';
DELETE FROM career_applications WHERE user_id = 'TEST_USER_ID';
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE id = 'TEST_USER_ID';
```

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Recent errors
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action LIKE '%error%' OR action LIKE '%invalid%'

-- Failed notifications
SELECT * FROM notification_outbox
WHERE status = 'failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Stuck applications
SELECT * FROM career_applications
WHERE application_state NOT IN ('submitted', 'rejected')
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'
AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
