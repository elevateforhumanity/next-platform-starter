## 10. Trial Funnel Verification Checklist

Added February 2025. Required before trial funnel goes live.

### External service verification

Run one real trial creation in staging/prod and confirm each hop:

| #   | Hop                                                            | How to verify                                                          | Status |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | API returns `correlationId`                                    | `curl -X POST /api/trial/start-managed` — check JSON response          |        |
| 2   | Supabase: `license_events.event_data.correlation_id` populated | Query `license_events` where `event_type = 'trial_self_service_start'` |        |
| 3   | Resend: outbound email includes `X-Correlation-ID` header      | Check Resend dashboard → Logs → email headers                          |        |
| 4   | GA4: `correlation_id` appears in DebugView                     | Open store/trial in Chrome with GA Debug extension                     |        |
| 5   | GA4: `correlation_id` queryable in reports                     | Verify custom dimension registered (see below)                         |        |

### GA4 custom dimension registration

This cannot be done in code. Manual step in Google Analytics admin panel:

1. Go to GA4 Admin → Custom definitions
2. Click "Create custom dimension"
3. Name: `Correlation ID`
4. Scope: `Event`
5. Event parameter: `correlation_id`
6. Save

Without this, `correlation_id` appears in DebugView but is not available in standard reports or explorations.

### Environment variables required

| Variable                        | Purpose             | Required for                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Database            | Trial creation, event logging     |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Admin DB access     | Trial API, admin endpoints        |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`                | Transactional email | Welcome email with correlation ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Analytics           | Client-side funnel tracking       |

### Operator review endpoint

`GET /api/admin/trial-events?days=7` — returns trial funnel events with summary stats and `setup_warnings` for missing configuration. Requires admin auth.
