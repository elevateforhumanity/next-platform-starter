## Critical Questions - Explicit Answers

### 1. Is the admin dashboard fully implemented and operational?

**Answer: PARTIAL**

**Evidence:**

| Feature                             | Status       | Evidence                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View all students                   | ✅ COMPLETE  | `app/admin/students/page.tsx` queries `profiles` with filters                   |
| View all partners                   | ✅ COMPLETE  | `app/admin/partners/page.tsx` queries `partners` table                          |
| View all enrollments                | ✅ COMPLETE  | `app/admin/enrollments/page.tsx` queries `program_enrollments`                  |
| View career applications with state | ❌ NOT WIRED | `app/admin/applications/page.tsx` queries `profiles`, NOT `career_applications` |
| View application state machine      | ❌ MISSING   | No admin page queries `career_applications.application_state`                   |
| Hours export                        | ✅ COMPLETE  | `app/admin/hours-export/page.tsx` exists                                        |
| Stuck approvals view                | ❌ MISSING   | No dedicated admin view for `approved_pending_user` partners                    |

**Gap:** Admin cannot see the application state machine we built. Need to wire `app/admin/applications/page.tsx` to `career_applications` table.

| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Admin applications | `/admin/applications` | Queries `profiles` not `career_applications` |

### NOT WIRED (Exists but not connected to correct data)

| Component          | Path                              | Should Query                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Admin applications | `/admin/applications/page.tsx`    | `career_applications` with `application_state` |
| Applicants live    | `/admin/applicants-live/page.tsx` | `career_applications`                          |

### MISSING (Does not exist)

| Component                    | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Admin stuck approvals view   | View partners in `approved_pending_user` state |
| Admin application state view | View `career_applications.application_state`   |

## Blocking Issues

| Issue                                | Severity     | Impact                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Admin cannot view application states | **BLOCKING** | Cannot monitor state machine we built |

---

## Recommended Fix

Wire admin applications page to `career_applications`:

```typescript
// app/admin/applications/page.tsx should query:
const { data: applications } = await supabase
  .from('career_applications')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Admin dashboard fully operational? | **PARTIAL** - missing application state view |
| Students can clock hours?          | **YES**                                      |
| Partners can approve hours?        | **YES**                                      |
