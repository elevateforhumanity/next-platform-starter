**Indiana / DOL expectation:** Clear administrative authority and control.

**Alignment:**

- Elevate for Humanity serves as the Program Administrator

### 2. Student Intake & Eligibility

**Expectation:** Eligibility verification before participation.

**Alignment:**

- Intake enforced through a server-side application state machine
- Eligibility, documentation, and review steps must be completed in sequence
- Applications cannot be submitted out of order or partially

**Statement:**

> Student eligibility and intake completion are enforced through a controlled, step-based application workflow. Applications cannot be submitted unless all required eligibility and documentation steps are completed and validated.

---

### 3. Enrollment & Participation Tracking

**Expectation:** Accurate enrollment records and participation tracking.

**Alignment:**

- Enrollment provisioning handled through atomic database transactions
- Program and course enrollments are created together or not at all

**Statement:**

> Enrollment records are provisioned through transactional safeguards that prevent partial or duplicate enrollments, ensuring accurate participation tracking.

### 4. Employer / Partner Participation

**Expectation:** Approved employers only, with documented access control.

**Alignment:**

- Partners are explicitly approved, denied, or suspended
- No access granted until approval is complete and auditable

**Statement:**

> Employer and partner participation is controlled through an explicit approval process that ensures only authorized entities may participate in apprenticeship or training activities.

### 5. Recordkeeping & Auditability

**Expectation:** Auditable lifecycle records.

**Alignment:**
