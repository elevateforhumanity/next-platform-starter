# SEO & Content Governance Summary

**For Buyers, Partners, and Compliance Review**

---

## Overview

Elevate for Humanity operates a governed content and indexing system designed to ensure that all publicly visible content is accurate, compliant, and aligned with platform capabilities.

This document summarizes our approach to search engine optimization (SEO), content governance, and crawl control.

## Governance Principles

| Principle                   | Implementation                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Publishing ≠ Indexing**   | Pages may be published freely; indexing requires explicit approval |
| **Whitelist-only indexing** | Only pre-approved pages appear in search results                   |
| **Compliance alignment**    | All indexed content reviewed against authoritative documents       |
| **Automated enforcement**   | CI/CD blocks non-compliant changes before deployment               |

---

## What Gets Indexed

### Approved for Search Indexing

- Marketing and informational pages
- Program overviews (not course content)
- Resource guides (informational only)
- Governance and transparency documents
- Public store pages

### Never Indexed

- Authentication flows
- User dashboards
- Administrative interfaces
- Checkout and payment flows
- Personalized or dynamic content
- Internal tools

---

## Content Standards

All indexed content must:

1. **Be factual** — No unsupported claims or guarantees
2. **Be stable** — Content does not change per user
3. **Be complete** — No placeholders or "coming soon" sections
4. **Be evergreen** — Valid for at least 6 months
5. **Include disclosures** — Where applicable

---

## Technical Controls

### Robots & Crawl Control

- `robots.txt` explicitly blocks sensitive routes
- Default directive for new pages: `noindex, follow`
- Sitemap contains only whitelisted URLs

### Metadata Discipline

- Every indexed page has unique title and description
- Canonical URLs point to production domain only
- No duplicate metadata across pages

### CI/CD Enforcement

- Automated SEO validation runs on every build
- Build fails if indexing rules are violated
- Whitelist changes require governance approval

---

## Monitoring

| Frequency | Activity                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Weekly    | Search Console coverage scan     |
| Weekly    | Index count vs sitemap audit     |
| Monthly   | Full indexed page inventory      |
| Monthly   | Thin content and canonical audit |

---

## Change Management

Changes to indexed content require:

1. Review against compliance framework
2. Explicit approval from Platform Governance
3. Update to SEO whitelist (if adding new indexed pages)
4. Passing CI validation

Emergency changes may be deployed but must be reviewed within 24 hours.

## Compliance Alignment

Our SEO practices are designed to support:

- **Payment processor requirements** — Accurate product/service descriptions
- **Regulatory expectations** — No misleading claims
- **Buyer diligence** — Transparent, verifiable content
- **User trust** — Consistent experience between marketing and product

---

## Summary

Elevate for Humanity treats search visibility as a governance function, not a marketing function. Content that appears in search results is explicitly approved, regularly audited, and automatically enforced through technical controls.

This approach ensures that what users find in search accurately represents what the platform delivers.
