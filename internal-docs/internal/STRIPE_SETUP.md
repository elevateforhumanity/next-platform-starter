## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are already configured. Ensure these endpoints are registered in Stripe:

1. **Main Webhook:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.*`

2. **License Webhook:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe-identity`
   - Events: `identity.verification_session.*`

## Testing

1. Create products in Stripe Dashboard
2. Copy Price IDs to code
3. Test checkout flow at `/checkout/student`
4. Verify webhook fires at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Check database for enrollment record

## Webhook Testing

### Using Stripe CLI (Recommended)

1. Install Stripe CLI: `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`
2. Login: `stripe login`
3. Forward webhooks to local:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
4. Trigger test events:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
   ```

### Webhook Events Handled

| Event                           | Action                                  |
