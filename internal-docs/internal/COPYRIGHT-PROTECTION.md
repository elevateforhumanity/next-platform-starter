Before filing, collect:

- [ ] Screenshots of infringing site (with timestamps)
- [ ] URLs of all infringing pages
- [ ] Your original content URLs for comparison
- [ ] Evidence of your watermarks in their code (View Source → search "EFH-ORIGINAL")
- [ ] WHOIS lookup of their domain (whois.domaintools.com)
- [ ] Hosting provider identification (use whatismyipaddress.com/hostname-ip)

### Step 2: Identify Where to File

**Find their hosting provider:**

```bash
# Terminal commands
nslookup [their-domain.com]
whois [their-domain.com]
```

**Common hosting providers and DMCA pages:**
