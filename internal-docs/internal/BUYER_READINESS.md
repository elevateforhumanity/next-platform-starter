## Operational Quality Gates (Automation)

Every change is screened via CI:

| Check                       | Description                    | Fail Condition                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Link Integrity**          | Crawls all internal links      | Any broken link                                   |
| **Media Integrity**         | Verifies all image/video URLs  | Any missing file                                  |
| **LMS Course Integrity**    | Validates course structure     | Placeholder content, missing modules, no owner    |
| **Store Product Integrity** | Validates product completeness | Missing price, description, or post-purchase flow |

All checks must pass before deployment.

### Path to A+

The remaining path to A+ is operational history and published aggregate metrics (tax season performance, completion rates, support resolution, opt-in rates), not design changes.
