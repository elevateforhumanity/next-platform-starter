## Reliability Gate

Every box must be checked before merge when this PR touches enrollment, booking, payment, application, or auth flows.

### API routes

- [ ] No API route returns `success: true` after a DB write failure
- [ ] No `catch` block logs and continues — persistence failures return non-2xx
- [ ] Native form POST routes redirect on both success and error — no raw JSON responses
- [ ] Email / notification sends only run **after** a confirmed DB write

### Client submit handlers

- [ ] Handlers validate payload `success` and a required identifier — not just `response.ok`
- [ ] Error states are visible to the user inline — not console-only
- [ ] Double-submit is prevented while a request is in flight

### Revenue / enrollment / booking / payment flows

- [ ] Payment or next-step redirect only happens after a real persisted record ID is confirmed
- [ ] Failure paths keep the user on-page with a recoverable error message
- [ ] These flows were manually broken and re-tested

### Guard scripts

- [ ] `pnpm lint:reliability` passes
- [ ] `pnpm lint:critical-routes` passes

> **Rule: No DB record = no success state.**

## Pre-auth Registry Check

> **Required for any PR that adds or modifies a public-write route, webhook, intake form,
> application form, enrollment flow, checkout flow, or anonymous insert path.**

- [ ] This PR does **NOT** add or modify any public-write route or anonymous insert path
- [ ] This PR **does** add or modify a public-write path — and I have done the following:

  **If the new table needs user_id reconciliation after account creation:**
  - [ ] Table added to `lib/pre-auth-tables.ts` with `mode: 'reconcile'`
  - [ ] `emailColumn` and `userIdColumn` are correct
  - [ ] `scripts/detect-orphaned-rows.sql` updated to include the new table
  - [ ] Detection query run in Supabase and returns 0 linkable rows

  **If the table is intentionally anonymous (no user_id ever needed):**
  - [ ] Table added to `lib/pre-auth-tables.ts` with `mode: 'anonymous'`
  - [ ] `reason` field explains why no reconciliation is needed

  **If the route is exempt from the registry (e.g. auth is enforced by a non-standard pattern):**
  - [ ] Route file contains `// pre-auth-registry: exempt — <reason>`

- [ ] `node scripts/check-pre-auth-registry.cjs` passes locally

> **Rule: Every public-write table must be consciously categorized. Unregistered pre-auth
> inserts block merge via the integrity-gate CI check.**
